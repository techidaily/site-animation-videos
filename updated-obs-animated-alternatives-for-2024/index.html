<p>It’s worth noting that people commonly use built-in <strong>OBS animated lower thirds</strong> for the job, but you can also use other editing tools to create custom animations and import them in your OBS Livestream.</p>
<p>This guide will walk you through everything you need to know about OBS animated lower thirds and their best alternatives you can use in 2022 and beyond.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Lower-Thirds-in-Animation"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Lower-Thirds-in-Animation" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is Lower Thirds in Animation?"></a>Part 1 What is Lower Thirds in Animation?</h2><p>To put it in simple words, a lower third is simply a graphic overlay that appears on top of the actual footage. As the name implies, the contents of the lower third usually occur at the lower end of the screen, but streamers can also configure the OBS settings to change their position within the screen. Ideally, lower third animations are utilized to give a context of the overall video.</p>
<p>Let’s say you are life streaming your GTA V gameplay on YouTube. So, to help first-time viewers get the overall context, you can add GTA-related elements in the lower third animation and maximize viewer acquisition. In addition to this, you can also use OBS animated lower-thirds to display exclusive offers and discounts throughout the live stream.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Set-Up-An-Animated-Lower-Third-In-OBS-Studio"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Set-Up-An-Animated-Lower-Third-In-OBS-Studio" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How To Set Up An Animated Lower Third In OBS Studio"></a>Part 2 How To Set Up An Animated Lower Third In OBS Studio</h2><p>So, now that you know the major benefits of using animated lower thirds in OBS studio, let’s understand how to set them up to make your live streams more engaging. It’s worth noting that OBS works around the concept of layers that you can manage individually to run your live streams. So, to add an <strong>animated lower third in OBS</strong> studio, all you have to do is add a dedicated layer and place it right above the video layer.</p>
<p>When it comes to setting up the lower-third, you’ll first need to create the graphics you want to display on top of the live streams. You can use Photoshop to design a custom lower-third animation if you are a professional designer. But, if you have just stepped into the world of live streams and don’t have any prior experience with Photoshop, you can also purchase one of the ready-to-use lower-third packages and import them directly to OBS.</p>
<p>Either way, it would be crucial to ensure that your <strong>OBS animated lower-third</strong> graphics do not interfere with the actual video. Why? Because this will make the video look more cluttered, and you’ll end up losing potential viewers.</p>
<p>Here’s a YouTube video that’ll walk you through the step-by-step procedure of creating lower-third animations in OBS Studio.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-8-AMAZING-OBS-Animated-Lower-Thirds-Alternatives"><a href="#Part-3-8-AMAZING-OBS-Animated-Lower-Thirds-Alternatives" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 8 AMAZING OBS Animated Lower Thirds Alternatives"></a>Part 3 8 AMAZING OBS Animated Lower Thirds Alternatives</h2><p>While OBS is a great tool to add lower-third animations to your live streams, it has its fair share of drawbacks. For instance, OBS has a pretty complicated interface, which means if you are an absolute beginner, you may not easily set up your live streams. Not to mention, OBS is heavy software - so if you don’t have a high-configuration system, you won’t be able to run the tool at all.</p>
<p>So, what’s your next best option? Fortunately, there are several OBS alternatives that you can use to set up <strong>OBS animated lower-third</strong> graphics and enhance the overall quality of your live streams. To make your job easier, we have cherry-picked 8 of the most reliable OBS alternatives that you can use to add lower-third animations to a Livestream video.</p>

<p>Like OBS, Wirecast is a popular video streaming platform that many content creators use to live stream on their social media handles. It also offers a layer-based architecture, which means users can add multiple layers separately and manage them through an easy-to-navigate panel.</p>
<p>One of the key reasons Wirecast is an ideal choice to add <strong>animated lower-third</strong> graphics to your live streams is its built-in collections. The tool already has several ready-to-integrate lower-third animations that one could import into their project without any hassle.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Built-in lower-third graphic templates</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Easy-to-use Interface</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Switch between multiple camera angles with one click</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Unlike OBS Studio, Wirecast isn’t available for free</p>
<p><strong>Why Do We Recommend Wirecast?</strong></p>
<p>Wirecast is a fully functional video streaming platform where you can easily manage all your live streams. Wirecast offers far better functionality than OBS Studio despite having a relatively easy-to-use UI.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Lower-Thirds-in-Animation-1"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Lower-Thirds-in-Animation-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is Lower Thirds in Animation?"></a>Part 1 What is Lower Thirds in Animation?</h2><p>To put it in simple words, a lower third is simply a graphic overlay that appears on top of the actual footage. As the name implies, the contents of the lower third usually occur at the lower end of the screen, but streamers can also configure the OBS settings to change their position within the screen. Ideally, lower third animations are utilized to give a context of the overall video.</p>
<p>Let’s say you are life streaming your GTA V gameplay on YouTube. So, to help first-time viewers get the overall context, you can add GTA-related elements in the lower third animation and maximize viewer acquisition. In addition to this, you can also use OBS animated lower-thirds to display exclusive offers and discounts throughout the live stream.</p>

It’s worth noting that OBS works around the concept of layers that you can manage individually to run your live streams. So, to add an <strong>animated lower third in OBS</strong> studio, all you have to do is add a dedicated layer and place it right above the video layer.</p>
<p>When it comes to setting up the lower-third, you’ll first need to create the graphics you want to display on top of the live streams. You can use Photoshop to design a custom lower-third animation if you are a professional designer. But, if you have just stepped into the world of live streams and don’t have any prior experience with Photoshop, you can also purchase one of the ready-to-use lower-third packages and import them directly to OBS.</p>
<p>Either way, it would be crucial to ensure that your <strong>OBS animated lower-third</strong> graphics do not interfere with the actual video. Why? Because this will make the video look more cluttered, and you’ll end up losing potential viewers.</p>
<p>Here’s a YouTube video that’ll walk you through the step-by-step procedure of creating lower-third animations in OBS Studio.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-8-AMAZING-OBS-Animated-Lower-Thirds-Alternatives-1"><a href="#Part-3-8-AMAZING-OBS-Animated-Lower-Thirds-Alternatives-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 8 AMAZING OBS Animated Lower Thirds Alternatives"></a>Part 3 8 AMAZING OBS Animated Lower Thirds Alternatives</h2><p>While OBS is a great tool to add lower-third animations to your live streams, it has its fair share of drawbacks. For instance, OBS has a pretty complicated interface, which means if you are an absolute beginner, you may not easily set up your live streams. Not to mention, OBS is heavy software - so if you don’t have a high-configuration system, you won’t be able to run the tool at all.</p>
<p>So, what’s your next best option? Fortunately, there are several OBS alternatives that you can use to set up <strong>OBS animated lower-third</strong> graphics and enhance the overall quality of your live streams. To make your job easier, we have cherry-picked 8 of the most reliable OBS alternatives that you can use to add lower-third animations to a Livestream video.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Lower-Thirds-in-Animation-2"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Lower-Thirds-in-Animation-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is Lower Thirds in Animation?"></a>Part 1 What is Lower Thirds in Animation?</h2><p>To put it in simple words, a lower third is simply a graphic overlay that appears on top of the actual footage. As the name implies, the contents of the lower third usually occur at the lower end of the screen, but streamers can also configure the OBS settings to change their position within the screen. Ideally, lower third animations are utilized to give a context of the overall video.</p>
<p>Let’s say you are life streaming your GTA V gameplay on YouTube. So, to help first-time viewers get the overall context, you can add GTA-related elements in the lower third animation and maximize viewer acquisition. In addition to this, you can also use OBS animated lower-thirds to display exclusive offers and discounts throughout the live stream.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Set-Up-An-Animated-Lower-Third-In-OBS-Studio-2"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Set-Up-An-Animated-Lower-Third-In-OBS-Studio-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How To Set Up An Animated Lower Third In OBS Studio"></a>Part 2 How To Set Up An Animated Lower Third In OBS Studio</h2><p>So, now that you know the major benefits of using animated lower thirds in OBS studio, let’s understand how to set them up to make your live streams more engaging. It’s worth noting that OBS works around the concept of layers that you can manage individually to run your live streams. So, to add an <strong>animated lower third in OBS</strong> studio, all you have to do is add a dedicated layer and place it right above the video layer.</p>
<p>When it comes to setting up the lower-third, you’ll first need to create the graphics you want to display on top of the live streams. You can use Photoshop to design a custom lower-third animation if you are a professional designer. But, if you have just stepped into the world of live streams and don’t have any prior experience with Photoshop, you can also purchase one of the ready-to-use lower-third packages and import them directly to OBS.</p>
<p>Either way, it would be crucial to ensure that your <strong>OBS animated lower-third</strong> graphics do not interfere with the actual video. Why? Because this will make the video look more cluttered, and you’ll end up losing potential viewers.</p>
<p>Here’s a YouTube video that’ll walk you through the step-by-step procedure of creating lower-third animations in OBS Studio.</p>

Not to mention, OBS is heavy software - so if you don’t have a high-configuration system, you won’t be able to run the tool at all.</p>
<p>So, what’s your next best option? Fortunately, there are several OBS alternatives that you can use to set up <strong>OBS animated lower-third</strong> graphics and enhance the overall quality of your live streams.

<p>Before you act surprised, let us clarify that Adobe Photoshop isn’t an alternative to OBS Studio. However, you can use it to create customized overlays and lower-third graphics to add a personal touch to your live streams. Suppose you are already familiar with Photoshop and have been using it for a few years. In that case, it’ll allow you to design personalized text overlays, graphics, animations, and logos for your live streams.</p>
<p>And, once you have successfully designed the lower-third overlays, you can use any of the live stream managers to add them to your live streams.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Design custom overlays for your social media live streams</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Offers advanced editing options to customize logos and lower-third graphics</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>

<p>ShareX is also an open-source screen recorder and lives stream manager that offers all the OBS features you’ll need to manage your live streams and add multiple lower-third overlays. The only downside of ShareX is that it has a complicated user interface. Even if you have used OBS in the past, you’ll find ShareX’s user interface relatively complex.

<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Upload and save pictures, videos, logos for lower-third overlays</p>

                ></p>
<p>Before you act surprised, let us clarify that Adobe Photoshop isn’t an alternative to OBS Studio. However, you can use it to create customized overlays and lower-third graphics to add a personal touch to your live streams. Suppose you are already familiar with Photoshop and have been using it for a few years. In that case, it’ll allow you to design personalized text overlays, graphics, animations, and logos for your live streams.</p>
<p>And, once you have successfully designed the lower-third overlays, you can use any of the live stream managers to add them to your live streams.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Design custom overlays for your social media live streams</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Offers advanced editing options to customize logos and lower-third graphics</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Photoshop has a steep learning curve, and if you are not an experienced designer, you won’t be able to design custom overlays</p>
<p><strong>Why Do We Recommend Adobe Photoshop?</strong></p>
<p>Adobe Photoshop is a reliable choice for creators who find the built-in media libraries of a live stream manager limited. With Photoshop, you’ll be able to design custom overlays for your live streams.</p>
<h3 id="06ShareX-3"><a href="#06ShareX-3" class="headerlink" title="06ShareX"></a>06ShareX</h3><p><img

                      alt="ShareX"
                ></p>
<p>ShareX is also an open-source screen recorder and lives stream manager that offers all the OBS features you’ll need to manage your live streams and add multiple lower-third overlays. The only downside of ShareX is that it has a complicated user interface. Even if you have used OBS in the past, you’ll find ShareX’s user interface relatively complex. So, you should only sign up for ShareX if you are comfortable with complex user interfaces.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Upload and save pictures, videos, logos for lower-third overlays</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Record your entire screen or a specific window</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Assign hotkeys to switch between multiple windows during the Livestream</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The user interface isn’t as friendly as other available options</p>
<p><strong>Why Do We Recommend ShareX?</strong></p>
<p>ShareX is an ideal <strong>OBS animated lower-third</strong> alternative for users who need a free-of-cost solution to manage their live streams.</p>

                      alt="Canva"
                ></p>
<p>Again, Canva doesn’t support live stream management at all. However, like Adobe Photoshop, you can use Canva to create stunning lower-third overlays for your Livestream sessions. The major benefit of using Canva is that it has thousands of pre-made templates that you can import to your design with one click. All these templates are fully customizable - so you’ll be able to design custom lower-third overlays for your live streams.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Comparatively less complicated than Adobe Photoshop</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Canva is affordable</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Being a web-based designing tool, you can access Canva on any device</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The premium version of Canva is relatively expensive than its competitors.</p>
<p><strong>Why Do We Recommend Canva?</strong></p>
<p>Canva is a one-stop solution for content creators looking for an additional designing tool to create custom OBS animated lower thirds for their live streams.</p>
<h2 id="Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-3"><a href="#Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-3" class="headerlink" title="Key Takeaways from This Episode"></a>Key Takeaways from This Episode</h2><p><strong>●</strong> OBS animated lower-thirds are one of the most effective ways to share the context of a live stream with your viewers</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> With OBS Studio, you have the liberty to import custom animated lower-third animations and overlays and add them to the live stream through its layered architecture</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Apart from OBS Studio, there are several other tools (such as Wondershare Filmora Pro) to add animated lower-thirds to live streams.</p>

<p>The best part about cartoons is that there’s something for everyone. There are <strong>iconic cartoon characters</strong> that are humorous, cute, and cool.</p>
<p>Since Paste first published this list a decade ago, a lot has changed in the world of cartoons. New episodes of The Simpsons, Family Guy, South Park, and SpongeBob Squarepants get released regularly, but that’s only the tip of the iceberg. Traditional cable networks have spawned new and exciting animated characters and settings while streaming services have enabled even more creators to produce the animated shows they want.</p>
<p>We thought to update our list of the 12 most <strong>iconic cartoon characters</strong> of all time, considering the cultural influence, relatability, and significance these animated humans, animals, vegetables, and other creatures had within the sphere of animation in 2020. Many of these characters have gone beyond their cartoon origins into other media. Still, for this list, we’ll only look at them as they appear in cartoons, whether they’re from the program itself or related comics and books.</p>
<h3 id="01Fred-Flintstone"><a href="#01Fred-Flintstone" class="headerlink" title="01Fred Flintstone"></a>01Fred Flintstone</h3><p><img

                      alt="fred flintstone"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Created:</strong> 1960<br><strong>Creators:</strong> William Hanna, Joseph Barbera<br><strong>Voices:</strong> Jeff Bergman and Alan Reed, as well as a variety of others</p>
<p>Fred, the patriarch of his modern-day stone-age clan, was an outspoken supporter of cartoons. The original series was one of the most contentious shows on television in the 1960s, despite its benign appearance (the Flintstones are better recognized for their cereal and vitamin advertising).</p>
<p>Fred Flintstone, the <strong>iconic cartoon character</strong>, is not the best-drawn cartoon character ever. He is pleasant and faithful to his wife, Wilma, despite not being a terrific boxer. The character carries a lump of granite on his shoulders and shows no fear of jeopardizing his marriage and children. He’s still a hominid, a caveman with extraordinary strength and agility.</p>
<h3 id="02Mickey-Mouse"><a href="#02Mickey-Mouse" class="headerlink" title="02Mickey Mouse"></a>02Mickey Mouse</h3><p><img

                      alt="mickey mouse"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Created:</strong> 1928<br><strong>Creators:</strong> Walt Disney, Ub Iwerks<br><strong>Voices:</strong> Walt Disney, BretIwan, and other voices</p>
<p>Mickey Mouse, the Disney mascot, is easy to overlook. Without the joys of an adventurous, passionate mouse, there might not be a Disney kingdom. In 2024, nearly a century after Disney’s legendary Disney short “Steamboat Willie,” the public domain will glimpse the mouse.</p>
<p>Walt Disney initially produced the <strong>most iconic cartoon character</strong> Mickey Mouse in 1928. His unique red shorts and white gloves have helped him become one of the most well-known fictional characters in the world. He usually wears a white glove and a white cap, and his enormous, yellow shoes are a common sight. Mickey also sports a pair of white gloves and his white gloves and shorts. He also wears a giant red bow and his clothes, which makes him a versatile character.</p>
<h3 id="03SpongeBob-Squarepants"><a href="#03SpongeBob-Squarepants" class="headerlink" title="03SpongeBob Squarepants"></a>03SpongeBob Squarepants</h3><p><img

                      alt="spongebob squarepant"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Created:</strong> 1999<br><strong>Creator:</strong> Stephen Hillenburg<br><strong>Voice by</strong> Tom Kenny  </p>
<p>Although Sponge’s nautical nonsense was probably not to most parents’ liking, Tom Kenny’s renowned chuckle has become ingrained in viewers’ brains all across the world after two decades of programming.</p>
<p>For almost 30 years, the SpongeBob Squarepants series has been a hit. It’s a cartoon about Patrick, a yellow sea sponge which is enthusiastic about life. He works as a chef at the Krusty Krab and lives in a pineapple house. Patrick, who is also his best friend, is his best friend.</p>
<p>The characters are likable and harmless in general, while some of the songs in the show deal with contentious topics, many based on actual events. The show has been chastised for portraying kids as unpleasant, obnoxious, and even defiant and using many caustic languages. While the show is often entertaining, its messages can be contentious.</p>
<p>SpongeBob is a young adult who lives independently and works full-time despite his immaturity.</p>
<h3 id="04Tom-and-Jerry"><a href="#04Tom-and-Jerry" class="headerlink" title="04Tom and Jerry"></a>04Tom and Jerry</h3><p><img

                      alt="tom and jerry"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Created:</strong> 1941<br><strong>Creators:</strong> William Hanna, Joseph Barbera<br><strong>Voices:</strong> William Hanna and various other voices</p>
<p>The series, founded by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera in 1940, is perhaps most known for Metro-Goldwyn-161 Mayer’s theatrical short films.</p>
<p>Tom the cat and Jerry the mouse, the <strong>iconic cartoon characters</strong> star in the original shorts. They don’t always get along, but they’re usually delighted with each other and often laugh at their misfortunes. Each short features the two attempting to catch the other. This is a desperate attempt to make the other person unhappy, but it rarely works.</p>
<p>Tom and Jerry were minor characters in the early years of the show. There were a few distinctions between them and the human characters in the film. The first one focused more on the mouse than the human cast, but the second was more centered on the human.</p>
<h3 id="05Homer-Simpson"><a href="#05Homer-Simpson" class="headerlink" title="05Homer Simpson"></a>05Homer Simpson</h3><p><img

                ></p>
<p><strong>Created:</strong> 1987<br><strong>Creator:</strong> Matt Groening<br><strong>Voice:</strong> Dan Castellaneta</p>
<p>The Simpsons’ first two seasons centered on Bart. But it was genuinely stunning as the show became more Homer-centric. He is the average man at his most sluggish, hungry, dumb, intoxicated, and idiotic. Thanks to his tremendous heart, he is still the hero, hidden beneath all the doughnuts.</p>
<p>Homer is a talented pianist in addition to expressing his love for Marge. He can play the guitar and keyboard, and his barbershop music has garnered him a Grammy. His most remarkable musical gift is his powerful operatic voice, which he uses in his band, Babysitter Bandit. His singing voice has won him fans worldwide, and he has played in hundreds of bands.</p>

<p><strong>Created:</strong> 1950<br><strong>Creator:</strong> Charles M. Schulz<br><strong>Voice:</strong> Bill Melendez, Peter Robbins and other.</p>
<p>Charlie Brown and Snoopy came to life through a few TV specials and later series, even though not all of the characters made it to television. Snoopy’s Red Baron fantasies and friendship with Woodstock were popular with children. They were also fans of Lucy’s crush. Charlie was well-liked by the older crowd. Charlie Brown, the hapless Charlie Brown, elicits as much sympathy as any animated character. We pull for him even though we know it will all be for naught.</p>
<p>Charlie Brown and Snoopy are part of the Peanuts Gang, an iconic group of cartoon characters. You’ve undoubtedly seen these two cartoon heroes previously if you haven’t heard of them. These two are from the well-known Peanuts cartoon series. They are famous children’s characters who are appreciated by many.</p>

<p><strong>Created:</strong> 1940<br><strong>Creators:</strong> Ben Hardaway, Tex Avery<br><strong>Voices:</strong> Mel Blanc, Jeff Bergman and other voices</p>
<p>The most fabulous cat cartoon in history is a rabbit, alternatively, a hare. This little taxonomic distinction went unmentioned in numerous shenanigans. Regardless of whether the rabbit was hunting with Elmer Fudd’s shotgun, Yosemite Samantha’s pistols, or Marvin Martian’s ACME Disintegration Gun, he maintained an enviable insouciance. The iconic visage of Warner Bros. had one flaw: terrible direction sense, particularly while digging across New Mexico.</p>
<p>Bugs Bunny is a late-thirties animated cartoon character created by Leon Schlesinger Productions. Mel Blanc provided his voice for him, and he has acted in several short films and television series. Many children were enthralled by the show, while the characters and stories fascinated others.</p>

<p>Scooby-Doo and Shaggy’s narrative has been a popular one for a long time. They have similar personalities and chemistry, as well as the same interests. They are close friends and have a passion for numerous types of food. They are mostly eating and lounging around, screaming in panic when presented with something frightening. They are the easiest to fall in love with. Despite all Scooby-countless Doo’s incarnations, this man-dog pair remains timeless.</p>
<p>Norville “Shaggy” Rogers is a fictitious character in the Scooby-Doo series. He is well known as the cowardly slacker with whom Scooby-Doo is constantly conversing. Scooby-Doo and Shaggy are the two primary characters in Mystery Incorporated. They both came from the same puppy farm.</p>

<p>The Disney adventures of Winnie-the-Pooh were as famous as his books. Winnie-the-Pooh was famous for his lovely temperament and generous heart who also admitted to have a sweet tooth.</p>
<p>Winnie-the-Pooh, an anthropomorphic teddy bear, is one of the most well-known children’s books. A. Milne wrote the book, and E. H. Shepard illustrated it. Winnie’s friendship with Eeyore, Christopher Robin, Kanga, Rabbit, Piglet, Roo, Owl, and Tigger is depicted in the story.</p>

<p>While many <strong>iconic cartoon characters</strong> have desired to be rulers of the world, none could ever envision being a benign tyrant like The Brain. Pinky, The Brain’s not-so-reliable companion, may give him headaches, but his zeal is contagious, and his loyalty makes him easy to love.</p>

<p>The Powerpuff Girls, the i<strong>conic female cartoon characters</strong> and the ideal vanguard of “you can be pretty and yet kick-ass,” emerged on the 90s cartoon landscape eager to inspire and amuse a generation. The eventual lesson was that working together is the most robust play, regardless of who you identified with the most.</p>

<p>The redemption arc of Will Arnett’s anthropomorphized, misanthropic horse is one of the most nuanced and profoundly felt of any TV character. Even when he didn’t love himself, we could love him because he was damaged and created damage wherever he went. Never has a cartoon covered such complex and challenging subjects with such finesse. It was an added advantage that it was continuously funny, and at the center of it all was a washed-up ‘90s sitcom actor dealing in the aftermath of his success.</p>

<p>That’s right: Zuko, not Aang! Zuko does not appear to be the same character in the first and end episodes. The former is a haughty prince with a ponytail who can’t seem to keep his fury and angst in check. The latter is a more emotionally intelligent figure, embracing his uncle and pleading for forgiveness with tears in his eyes. However, when viewed in order, the transition between the two is seamless. Zuko’s narrative is tragic yet uplifting, shaped by both hate and love, making him one of the best characters in animation, if not all of television.15.Leonardo, Raphael, Michelangelo, and Donatello (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)</p>

<p>For this list, we’ll concentrate on the original team, these radical pizza-eating ninja-style fighters with a rat for a sensei, yet tastefully named after some of history’s finest painters who became legendary for 90s youth. It’s impossible to choose the “best” <strong>iconic cartoon character</strong> in this soap because it depends on personal preference. They are, nonetheless, indispensable to pop culture history in all of their manifestations (even as a peak of “the show is for the toy”).</p>

<p>The best part about cartoons is that there’s something for everyone. There are <strong>iconic cartoon characters</strong> that are humorous, cute, and cool.</p>
<p>Since Paste first published this list a decade ago, a lot has changed in the world of cartoons. New episodes of The Simpsons, Family Guy, South Park, and SpongeBob Squarepants get released regularly, but that’s only the tip of the iceberg. Traditional cable networks have spawned new and exciting animated characters and settings while streaming services have enabled even more creators to produce the animated shows they want.</p>
<p>We thought to update our list of the 12 most <strong>iconic cartoon characters</strong> of all time, considering the cultural influence, relatability, and significance these animated humans, animals, vegetables, and other creatures had within the sphere of animation in 2020. Many of these characters have gone beyond their cartoon origins into other media. Still, for this list, we’ll only look at them as they appear in cartoons, whether they’re from the program itself or related comics and books.</p>

<p><strong>Created:</strong> 1960<br><strong>Creators:</strong> William Hanna, Joseph Barbera<br><strong>Voices:</strong> Jeff Bergman and Alan Reed, as well as a variety of others</p>
<p>Fred, the patriarch of his modern-day stone-age clan, was an outspoken supporter of cartoons. The original series was one of the most contentious shows on television in the 1960s, despite its benign appearance (the Flintstones are better recognized for their cereal and vitamin advertising).</p>
<p>Fred Flintstone, the <strong>iconic cartoon character</strong>, is not the best-drawn cartoon character ever. He is pleasant and faithful to his wife, Wilma, despite not being a terrific boxer. The character carries a lump of granite on his shoulders and shows no fear of jeopardizing his marriage and children. He’s still a hominid, a caveman with extraordinary strength and agility.</p>

<p>Mickey Mouse, the Disney mascot, is easy to overlook. Without the joys of an adventurous, passionate mouse, there might not be a Disney kingdom. In 2024, nearly a century after Disney’s legendary Disney short “Steamboat Willie,” the public domain will glimpse the mouse.</p>
<p>Walt Disney initially produced the <strong>most iconic cartoon character</strong> Mickey Mouse in 1928. His unique red shorts and white gloves have helped him become one of the most well-known fictional characters in the world. He usually wears a white glove and a white cap, and his enormous, yellow shoes are a common sight. Mickey also sports a pair of white gloves and his white gloves and shorts. He also wears a giant red bow and his clothes, which makes him a versatile character.</p>

<p><strong>Created:</strong> 1999<br><strong>Creator:</strong> Stephen Hillenburg<br><strong>Voice by</strong> Tom Kenny  </p>
<p>Although Sponge’s nautical nonsense was probably not to most parents’ liking, Tom Kenny’s renowned chuckle has become ingrained in viewers’ brains all across the world after two decades of programming.</p>
<p>For almost 30 years, the SpongeBob Squarepants series has been a hit. It’s a cartoon about Patrick, a yellow sea sponge which is enthusiastic about life. He works as a chef at the Krusty Krab and lives in a pineapple house. Patrick, who is also his best friend, is his best friend.</p>
<p>The characters are likable and harmless in general, while some of the songs in the show deal with contentious topics, many based on actual events. The show has been chastised for portraying kids as unpleasant, obnoxious, and even defiant and using many caustic languages. While the show is often entertaining, its messages can be contentious.</p>
<p>SpongeBob is a young adult who lives independently and works full-time despite his immaturity.</p>

<p><strong>Created:</strong> 1941<br><strong>Creators:</strong> William Hanna, Joseph Barbera<br><strong>Voices:</strong> William Hanna and various other voices</p>
<p>The series, founded by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera in 1940, is perhaps most known for Metro-Goldwyn-161 Mayer’s theatrical short films.</p>
<p>Tom the cat and Jerry the mouse, the <strong>iconic cartoon characters</strong> star in the original shorts. They don’t always get along, but they’re usually delighted with each other and often laugh at their misfortunes. Each short features the two attempting to catch the other. This is a desperate attempt to make the other person unhappy, but it rarely works.</p>
<p>Tom and Jerry were minor characters in the early years of the show. There were a few distinctions between them and the human characters in the film. The first one focused more on the mouse than the human cast, but the second was more centered on the human.</p>

<p>The Simpsons’ first two seasons centered on Bart. But it was genuinely stunning as the show became more Homer-centric. He is the average man at his most sluggish, hungry, dumb, intoxicated, and idiotic. Thanks to his tremendous heart, he is still the hero, hidden beneath all the doughnuts.</p>
<p>Homer is a talented pianist in addition to expressing his love for Marge. He can play the guitar and keyboard, and his barbershop music has garnered him a Grammy. His most remarkable musical gift is his powerful operatic voice, which he uses in his band, Babysitter Bandit. His singing voice has won him fans worldwide, and he has played in hundreds of bands.</p>

<p>Charlie Brown and Snoopy came to life through a few TV specials and later series, even though not all of the characters made it to television. Snoopy’s Red Baron fantasies and friendship with Woodstock were popular with children. They were also fans of Lucy’s crush. Charlie was well-liked by the older crowd. Charlie Brown, the hapless Charlie Brown, elicits as much sympathy as any animated character. We pull for him even though we know it will all be for naught.</p>
<p>Charlie Brown and Snoopy are part of the Peanuts Gang, an iconic group of cartoon characters. You’ve undoubtedly seen these two cartoon heroes previously if you haven’t heard of them. These two are from the well-known Peanuts cartoon series. They are famous children’s characters who are appreciated by many.</p>

<p>The most fabulous cat cartoon in history is a rabbit, alternatively, a hare. This little taxonomic distinction went unmentioned in numerous shenanigans. Regardless of whether the rabbit was hunting with Elmer Fudd’s shotgun, Yosemite Samantha’s pistols, or Marvin Martian’s ACME Disintegration Gun, he maintained an enviable insouciance. The iconic visage of Warner Bros. had one flaw: terrible direction sense, particularly while digging across New Mexico.</p>
<p>Bugs Bunny is a late-thirties animated cartoon character created by Leon Schlesinger Productions. Mel Blanc provided his voice for him, and he has acted in several short films and television series. Many children were enthralled by the show, while the characters and stories fascinated others.</p>

<p>Scooby-Doo and Shaggy’s narrative has been a popular one for a long time. They have similar personalities and chemistry, as well as the same interests. They are close friends and have a passion for numerous types of food. They are mostly eating and lounging around, screaming in panic when presented with something frightening. They are the easiest to fall in love with. Despite all Scooby-countless Doo’s incarnations, this man-dog pair remains timeless.</p>
<p>Norville “Shaggy” Rogers is a fictitious character in the Scooby-Doo series. He is well known as the cowardly slacker with whom Scooby-Doo is constantly conversing. Scooby-Doo and Shaggy are the two primary characters in Mystery Incorporated. They both came from the same puppy farm.</p>

<p>That’s right: Zuko, not Aang! Zuko does not appear to be the same character in the first and end episodes. The former is a haughty prince with a ponytail who can’t seem to keep his fury and angst in check. The latter is a more emotionally intelligent figure, embracing his uncle and pleading for forgiveness with tears in his eyes. However, when viewed in order, the transition between the two is seamless. Zuko’s narrative is tragic yet uplifting, shaped by both hate and love, making him one of the best characters in animation, if not all of television.15.Leonardo, Raphael, Michelangelo, and Donatello (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)</p>

<p>The best part about cartoons is that there’s something for everyone. There are <strong>iconic cartoon characters</strong> that are humorous, cute, and cool.</p>
<p>Since Paste first published this list a decade ago, a lot has changed in the world of cartoons. New episodes of The Simpsons, Family Guy, South Park, and SpongeBob Squarepants get released regularly, but that’s only the tip of the iceberg. Traditional cable networks have spawned new and exciting animated characters and settings while streaming services have enabled even more creators to produce the animated shows they want.</p>
<p>We thought to update our list of the 12 most <strong>iconic cartoon characters</strong> of all time, considering the cultural influence, relatability, and significance these animated humans, animals, vegetables, and other creatures had within the sphere of animation in 2020. Many of these characters have gone beyond their cartoon origins into other media. Still, for this list, we’ll only look at them as they appear in cartoons, whether they’re from the program itself or related comics and books.</p>

<p><strong>Created:</strong> 1960<br><strong>Creators:</strong> William Hanna, Joseph Barbera<br><strong>Voices:</strong> Jeff Bergman and Alan Reed, as well as a variety of others</p>
<p>Fred, the patriarch of his modern-day stone-age clan, was an outspoken supporter of cartoons. The original series was one of the most contentious shows on television in the 1960s, despite its benign appearance (the Flintstones are better recognized for their cereal and vitamin advertising).</p>
<p>Fred Flintstone, the <strong>iconic cartoon character</strong>, is not the best-drawn cartoon character ever. He is pleasant and faithful to his wife, Wilma, despite not being a terrific boxer. The character carries a lump of granite on his shoulders and shows no fear of jeopardizing his marriage and children. He’s still a hominid, a caveman with extraordinary strength and agility.</p>

<p><strong>Created:</strong> 1928<br><strong>Creators:</strong> Walt Disney, Ub Iwerks<br><strong>Voices:</strong> Walt Disney, BretIwan, and other voices</p>
<p>Mickey Mouse, the Disney mascot, is easy to overlook. Without the joys of an adventurous, passionate mouse, there might not be a Disney kingdom. In 2024, nearly a century after Disney’s legendary Disney short “Steamboat Willie,” the public domain will glimpse the mouse.</p>
<p>Walt Disney initially produced the <strong>most iconic cartoon character</strong> Mickey Mouse in 1928. His unique red shorts and white gloves have helped him become one of the most well-known fictional characters in the world. He usually wears a white glove and a white cap, and his enormous, yellow shoes are a common sight. Mickey also sports a pair of white gloves and his white gloves and shorts. He also wears a giant red bow and his clothes, which makes him a versatile character.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Created:</strong> 1999<br><strong>Creator:</strong> Stephen Hillenburg<br><strong>Voice by</strong> Tom Kenny  </p>
<p>Although Sponge’s nautical nonsense was probably not to most parents’ liking, Tom Kenny’s renowned chuckle has become ingrained in viewers’ brains all across the world after two decades of programming.</p>
<p>For almost 30 years, the SpongeBob Squarepants series has been a hit. It’s a cartoon about Patrick, a yellow sea sponge which is enthusiastic about life. He works as a chef at the Krusty Krab and lives in a pineapple house. Patrick, who is also his best friend, is his best friend.</p>
<p>The characters are likable and harmless in general, while some of the songs in the show deal with contentious topics, many based on actual events. The show has been chastised for portraying kids as unpleasant, obnoxious, and even defiant and using many caustic languages. While the show is often entertaining, its messages can be contentious.</p>
<p>SpongeBob is a young adult who lives independently and works full-time despite his immaturity.</p>

<p><strong>Created:</strong> 1941<br><strong>Creators:</strong> William Hanna, Joseph Barbera<br><strong>Voices:</strong> William Hanna and various other voices</p>
<p>The series, founded by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera in 1940, is perhaps most known for Metro-Goldwyn-161 Mayer’s theatrical short films.</p>
<p>Tom the cat and Jerry the mouse, the <strong>iconic cartoon characters</strong> star in the original shorts. They don’t always get along, but they’re usually delighted with each other and often laugh at their misfortunes. Each short features the two attempting to catch the other. This is a desperate attempt to make the other person unhappy, but it rarely works.</p>
<p>Tom and Jerry were minor characters in the early years of the show. There were a few distinctions between them and the human characters in the film. The first one focused more on the mouse than the human cast, but the second was more centered on the human.</p>

<p><strong>Created:</strong> 1987<br><strong>Creator:</strong> Matt Groening<br><strong>Voice:</strong> Dan Castellaneta</p>
<p>The Simpsons’ first two seasons centered on Bart. But it was genuinely stunning as the show became more Homer-centric. He is the average man at his most sluggish, hungry, dumb, intoxicated, and idiotic. Thanks to his tremendous heart, he is still the hero, hidden beneath all the doughnuts.</p>
<p>Homer is a talented pianist in addition to expressing his love for Marge. He can play the guitar and keyboard, and his barbershop music has garnered him a Grammy. His most remarkable musical gift is his powerful operatic voice, which he uses in his band, Babysitter Bandit. His singing voice has won him fans worldwide, and he has played in hundreds of bands.</p>

<p><strong>Created:</strong> 1950<br><strong>Creator:</strong> Charles M. Schulz<br><strong>Voice:</strong> Bill Melendez, Peter Robbins and other.</p>
<p>Charlie Brown and Snoopy came to life through a few TV specials and later series, even though not all of the characters made it to television. Snoopy’s Red Baron fantasies and friendship with Woodstock were popular with children. They were also fans of Lucy’s crush. Charlie was well-liked by the older crowd. Charlie Brown, the hapless Charlie Brown, elicits as much sympathy as any animated character. We pull for him even though we know it will all be for naught.</p>
<p>Charlie Brown and Snoopy are part of the Peanuts Gang, an iconic group of cartoon characters. You’ve undoubtedly seen these two cartoon heroes previously if you haven’t heard of them. These two are from the well-known Peanuts cartoon series. They are famous children’s characters who are appreciated by many.</p>

<p><strong>Created:</strong> 1940<br><strong>Creators:</strong> Ben Hardaway, Tex Avery<br><strong>Voices:</strong> Mel Blanc, Jeff Bergman and other voices</p>
<p>The most fabulous cat cartoon in history is a rabbit, alternatively, a hare. This little taxonomic distinction went unmentioned in numerous shenanigans. Regardless of whether the rabbit was hunting with Elmer Fudd’s shotgun, Yosemite Samantha’s pistols, or Marvin Martian’s ACME Disintegration Gun, he maintained an enviable insouciance. The iconic visage of Warner Bros. had one flaw: terrible direction sense, particularly while digging across New Mexico.</p>
<p>Bugs Bunny is a late-thirties animated cartoon character created by Leon Schlesinger Productions. Mel Blanc provided his voice for him, and he has acted in several short films and television series. Many children were enthralled by the show, while the characters and stories fascinated others.</p>

<p>Scooby-Doo and Shaggy’s narrative has been a popular one for a long time. They have similar personalities and chemistry, as well as the same interests. They are close friends and have a passion for numerous types of food. They are mostly eating and lounging around, screaming in panic when presented with something frightening. They are the easiest to fall in love with. Despite all Scooby-countless Doo’s incarnations, this man-dog pair remains timeless.</p>
<p>Norville “Shaggy” Rogers is a fictitious character in the Scooby-Doo series. He is well known as the cowardly slacker with whom Scooby-Doo is constantly conversing. Scooby-Doo and Shaggy are the two primary characters in Mystery Incorporated. They both came from the same puppy farm.</p>

<p>The Disney adventures of Winnie-the-Pooh were as famous as his books. Winnie-the-Pooh was famous for his lovely temperament and generous heart who also admitted to have a sweet tooth.</p>
<p>Winnie-the-Pooh, an anthropomorphic teddy bear, is one of the most well-known children’s books. A. Milne wrote the book, and E. H. Shepard illustrated it. Winnie’s friendship with Eeyore, Christopher Robin, Kanga, Rabbit, Piglet, Roo, Owl, and Tigger is depicted in the story.</p>

<p>While many <strong>iconic cartoon characters</strong> have desired to be rulers of the world, none could ever envision being a benign tyrant like The Brain. Pinky, The Brain’s not-so-reliable companion, may give him headaches, but his zeal is contagious, and his loyalty makes him easy to love.</p>

<p>The Powerpuff Girls, the i<strong>conic female cartoon characters</strong> and the ideal vanguard of “you can be pretty and yet kick-ass,” emerged on the 90s cartoon landscape eager to inspire and amuse a generation. The eventual lesson was that working together is the most robust play, regardless of who you identified with the most.</p>

<p><strong>Created:</strong> 2014<br><strong>Creator:</strong> Raphael Bob-Waksberg<br><strong>Voice:</strong> Will Arnett</p>
<p>The redemption arc of Will Arnett’s anthropomorphized, misanthropic horse is one of the most nuanced and profoundly felt of any TV character. Even when he didn’t love himself, we could love him because he was damaged and created damage wherever he went. Never has a cartoon covered such complex and challenging subjects with such finesse. It was an added advantage that it was continuously funny, and at the center of it all was a washed-up ‘90s sitcom actor dealing in the aftermath of his success.</p>

<p>That’s right: Zuko, not Aang! Zuko does not appear to be the same character in the first and end episodes. The former is a haughty prince with a ponytail who can’t seem to keep his fury and angst in check. The latter is a more emotionally intelligent figure, embracing his uncle and pleading for forgiveness with tears in his eyes. However, when viewed in order, the transition between the two is seamless. Zuko’s narrative is tragic yet uplifting, shaped by both hate and love, making him one of the best characters in animation, if not all of television.15.Leonardo, Raphael, Michelangelo, and Donatello (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)</p>

<p>For this list, we’ll concentrate on the original team, these radical pizza-eating ninja-style fighters with a rat for a sensei, yet tastefully named after some of history’s finest painters who became legendary for 90s youth. It’s impossible to choose the “best” <strong>iconic cartoon character</strong> in this soap because it depends on personal preference. They are, nonetheless, indispensable to pop culture history in all of their manifestations (even as a peak of “the show is for the toy”).</p>

His unique red shorts and white gloves have helped him become one of the most well-known fictional characters in the world. He usually wears a white glove and a white cap, and his enormous, yellow shoes are a common sight. Mickey also sports a pair of white gloves and his white gloves and shorts. He also wears a giant red bow and his clothes, which makes him a versatile character.</p>

<p><strong>Created:</strong> 1999<br><strong>Creator:</strong> Stephen Hillenburg<br><strong>Voice by</strong> Tom Kenny  </p>
<p>Although Sponge’s nautical nonsense was probably not to most parents’ liking, Tom Kenny’s renowned chuckle has become ingrained in viewers’ brains all across the world after two decades of programming.</p>
<p>For almost 30 years, the SpongeBob Squarepants series has been a hit. It’s a cartoon about Patrick, a yellow sea sponge which is enthusiastic about life. He works as a chef at the Krusty Krab and lives in a pineapple house. Patrick, who is also his best friend, is his best friend.</p>
<p>The characters are likable and harmless in general, while some of the songs in the show deal with contentious topics, many based on actual events. The show has been chastised for portraying kids as unpleasant, obnoxious, and even defiant and using many caustic languages. While the show is often entertaining, its messages can be contentious.</p>
<p>SpongeBob is a young adult who lives independently and works full-time despite his immaturity.</p>

<p><strong>Created:</strong> 1941<br><strong>Creators:</strong> William Hanna, Joseph Barbera<br><strong>Voices:</strong> William Hanna and various other voices</p>
<p>The series, founded by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera in 1940, is perhaps most known for Metro-Goldwyn-161 Mayer’s theatrical short films.</p>
<p>Tom the cat and Jerry the mouse, the <strong>iconic cartoon characters</strong> star in the original shorts. They don’t always get along, but they’re usually delighted with each other and often laugh at their misfortunes. Each short features the two attempting to catch the other. This is a desperate attempt to make the other person unhappy, but it rarely works.</p>
<p>Tom and Jerry were minor characters in the early years of the show. There were a few distinctions between them and the human characters in the film. The first one focused more on the mouse than the human cast, but the second was more centered on the human.</p>

<p><strong>Created:</strong> 1987<br><strong>Creator:</strong> Matt Groening<br><strong>Voice:</strong> Dan Castellaneta</p>
<p>The Simpsons’ first two seasons centered on Bart. But it was genuinely stunning as the show became more Homer-centric. He is the average man at his most sluggish, hungry, dumb, intoxicated, and idiotic. Thanks to his tremendous heart, he is still the hero, hidden beneath all the doughnuts.</p>
<p>Homer is a talented pianist in addition to expressing his love for Marge. He can play the guitar and keyboard, and his barbershop music has garnered him a Grammy. His most remarkable musical gift is his powerful operatic voice, which he uses in his band, Babysitter Bandit. His singing voice has won him fans worldwide, and he has played in hundreds of bands.</p>

<p>Charlie Brown and Snoopy came to life through a few TV specials and later series, even though not all of the characters made it to television. Snoopy’s Red Baron fantasies and friendship with Woodstock were popular with children. They were also fans of Lucy’s crush. Charlie was well-liked by the older crowd. Charlie Brown, the hapless Charlie Brown, elicits as much sympathy as any animated character. We pull for him even though we know it will all be for naught.</p>
<p>Charlie Brown and Snoopy are part of the Peanuts Gang, an iconic group of cartoon characters. You’ve undoubtedly seen these two cartoon heroes previously if you haven’t heard of them. These two are from the well-known Peanuts cartoon series. They are famous children’s characters who are appreciated by many.</p>

<p>The most fabulous cat cartoon in history is a rabbit, alternatively, a hare. This little taxonomic distinction went unmentioned in numerous shenanigans. Regardless of whether the rabbit was hunting with Elmer Fudd’s shotgun, Yosemite Samantha’s pistols, or Marvin Martian’s ACME Disintegration Gun, he maintained an enviable insouciance. The iconic visage of Warner Bros. had one flaw: terrible direction sense, particularly while digging across New Mexico.</p>
<p>Bugs Bunny is a late-thirties animated cartoon character created by Leon Schlesinger Productions. Mel Blanc provided his voice for him, and he has acted in several short films and television series. Many children were enthralled by the show, while the characters and stories fascinated others.</p>

<p>Scooby-Doo and Shaggy’s narrative has been a popular one for a long time. They have similar personalities and chemistry, as well as the same interests. They are close friends and have a passion for numerous types of food. They are mostly eating and lounging around, screaming in panic when presented with something frightening. They are the easiest to fall in love with. Despite all Scooby-countless Doo’s incarnations, this man-dog pair remains timeless.</p>
<p>Norville “Shaggy” Rogers is a fictitious character in the Scooby-Doo series. He is well known as the cowardly slacker with whom Scooby-Doo is constantly conversing. Scooby-Doo and Shaggy are the two primary characters in Mystery Incorporated. They both came from the same puppy farm.</p>

<p>The Disney adventures of Winnie-the-Pooh were as famous as his books. Winnie-the-Pooh was famous for his lovely temperament and generous heart who also admitted to have a sweet tooth.</p>
<p>Winnie-the-Pooh, an anthropomorphic teddy bear, is one of the most well-known children’s books. A. Milne wrote the book, and E. H. Shepard illustrated it. Winnie’s friendship with Eeyore, Christopher Robin, Kanga, Rabbit, Piglet, Roo, Owl, and Tigger is depicted in the story.</p>

<p>While many <strong>iconic cartoon characters</strong> have desired to be rulers of the world, none could ever envision being a benign tyrant like The Brain. Pinky, The Brain’s not-so-reliable companion, may give him headaches, but his zeal is contagious, and his loyalty makes him easy to love.</p>

<p>The Powerpuff Girls, the i<strong>conic female cartoon characters</strong> and the ideal vanguard of “you can be pretty and yet kick-ass,” emerged on the 90s cartoon landscape eager to inspire and amuse a generation. The eventual lesson was that working together is the most robust play, regardless of who you identified with the most.</p>

<p><strong>Created:</strong> 2014<br><strong>Creator:</strong> Raphael Bob-Waksberg<br><strong>Voice:</strong> Will Arnett</p>
<p>The redemption arc of Will Arnett’s anthropomorphized, misanthropic horse is one of the most nuanced and profoundly felt of any TV character. Even when he didn’t love himself, we could love him because he was damaged and created damage wherever he went. Never has a cartoon covered such complex and challenging subjects with such finesse. It was an added advantage that it was continuously funny, and at the center of it all was a washed-up ‘90s sitcom actor dealing in the aftermath of his success.</p>

<p>That’s right: Zuko, not Aang! Zuko does not appear to be the same character in the first and end episodes. The former is a haughty prince with a ponytail who can’t seem to keep his fury and angst in check. The latter is a more emotionally intelligent figure, embracing his uncle and pleading for forgiveness with tears in his eyes. However, when viewed in order, the transition between the two is seamless. Zuko’s narrative is tragic yet uplifting, shaped by both hate and love, making him one of the best characters in animation, if not all of television.15.Leonardo, Raphael, Michelangelo, and Donatello (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)</p>

<p>For this list, we’ll concentrate on the original team, these radical pizza-eating ninja-style fighters with a rat for a sensei, yet tastefully named after some of history’s finest painters who became legendary for 90s youth. It’s impossible to choose the “best” <strong>iconic cartoon character</strong> in this soap because it depends on personal preference. They are, nonetheless, indispensable to pop culture history in all of their manifestations (even as a peak of “the show is for the toy”).</p>
