                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> You can draw the mouth just below the nose and draw any of the shapes from the list given below. In addition, to make the mouth funnier, you should then add teeth by either drawing a small square sticking out inside the mouth from the upper side, at the roof of the mouth, or a straight horizontal line which is across the mouth and several vertical lines used to form a grid having two rows and many columns.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> A U-shaped curve that is large</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> A triangle like a right-angled one which is most preferred</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> A circle or an oval shape</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> A rectangle shapes</p>

<p>Read this article on how to draw the perfect cartoon character yourself:</p>
<p>Step 1: The first is to have an idea of what you want to draw, i.e., the picture you want to draw. You can pick any character to draw from your favorite website or WeeWorld.com.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> First, you draw the face but make sure you don’t add a nose but do a black outline.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Next, you can draw the other features but make sure you don’t use colored pencils. Only use your main writing utensil.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Then, remember to use your imagination to add the clothes and hairstyle.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Finally, you can delete any unwanted lines and color with artist utensils, such as crayons, paintbrushes, colored pencils, etc. Also, remember that you can add some detail to your character to make it pop out and be beautiful.</p>

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 01"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now you have officially made your cartoon, how does it feel?</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-do-funny-cartoon-drawings-9.png"
                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 02"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Next, you want to go back and draw again, but this time, not an imitation.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-do-funny-cartoon-drawings-10.png"
                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 03"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Pick up a new piece of paper to be used to draw another character. But this time, you need to change the features. You can decide to make the eyes bigger, neon skin, and maybe crazy hair. You can try clothes that you would love to wear, or ones you wish you could get. Also, try to change the size around to make the features look different and add a nose, and then you can finally color your creation.</p>

<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Now, you can compare the two drawings to notice the difference. You will realize that one is an imitation while the other is all you! Now, you can grab a new piece of notebook paper.</p>

<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Next is that you begin to jot down different ideas. For example, you may want to draw a cute little puppy or a cute baby. Sometimes you can decide that your cartoon could be about a talking apple or something different.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Grab another piece of paper and draw any other character you can imagine. You can try using a Sharpie marker for the outline by carefully tracing the pencil. Then you can erase any stray marks on the piece of paper. Next, you can also use any writing utensils like markers, crayons, colored pencils, pastels, or even paint, as it also works well.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> A U-shaped curve that is large</p>

<p>Step 1: The first is to have an idea of what you want to draw, i.e., the picture you want to draw. You can pick any character to draw from your favorite website or WeeWorld.com.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> First, you draw the face but make sure you don’t add a nose but do a black outline.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Next, you can draw the other features but make sure you don’t use colored pencils. Only use your main writing utensil.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Then, remember to use your imagination to add the clothes and hairstyle.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Finally, you can delete any unwanted lines and color with artist utensils, such as crayons, paintbrushes, colored pencils, etc. Also, remember that you can add some detail to your character to make it pop out and be beautiful.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now you have officially made your cartoon, how does it feel?</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Next, you want to go back and draw again, but this time, not an imitation.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Pick up a new piece of paper to be used to draw another character. But this time, you need to change the features. You can decide to make the eyes bigger, neon skin, and maybe crazy hair. You can try clothes that you would love to wear, or ones you wish you could get. Also, try to change the size around to make the features look different and add a nose, and then you can finally color your creation.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> A U-shaped curve that is large</p>

<p>Read this article on how to draw the perfect cartoon character yourself:</p>
<p>Step 1: The first is to have an idea of what you want to draw, i.e., the picture you want to draw. You can pick any character to draw from your favorite website or WeeWorld.com.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> First, you draw the face but make sure you don’t add a nose but do a black outline.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Next, you can draw the other features but make sure you don’t use colored pencils. Only use your main writing utensil.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Then, remember to use your imagination to add the clothes and hairstyle.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Finally, you can delete any unwanted lines and color with artist utensils, such as crayons, paintbrushes, colored pencils, etc. Also, remember that you can add some detail to your character to make it pop out and be beautiful.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now you have officially made your cartoon, how does it feel?</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 02"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Next, you want to go back and draw again, but this time, not an imitation.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 03"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Pick up a new piece of paper to be used to draw another character. But this time, you need to change the features. You can decide to make the eyes bigger, neon skin, and maybe crazy hair. You can try clothes that you would love to wear, or ones you wish you could get. Also, try to change the size around to make the features look different and add a nose, and then you can finally color your creation.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Now, you can compare the two drawings to notice the difference. You will realize that one is an imitation while the other is all you! Now, you can grab a new piece of notebook paper.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Next is that you begin to jot down different ideas. For example, you may want to draw a cute little puppy or a cute baby. Sometimes you can decide that your cartoon could be about a talking apple or something different.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 06"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Grab another piece of paper and draw any other character you can imagine. You can try using a Sharpie marker for the outline by carefully tracing the pencil. Then you can erase any stray marks on the piece of paper. Next, you can also use any writing utensils like markers, crayons, colored pencils, pastels, or even paint, as it also works well.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 8:</strong> You can grab your notebook sheet again and then jot down any idea of a comic series. Also, make a plot or funny lines that you could use or any other characters.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 08"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 9:</strong> Next, you fold the blank sheet of paper and make it into about four lines. And then you can draw your main character by just using a pencil first.</p>

                ></p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 11:</strong> Next is that you can draw the furniture and background, such as trees or anything else, to beautify your drawing.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> Any pear shapes</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> An upside-down triangle</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> A quadrilateral like a trapezium, a square, or any of your choice</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> To draw the nose in the middle of the face, draw somewhere any of the following;</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> A round shape that is bulgy</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> A U-shape</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> A V-shape</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> A small dash.</p>

                      alt="how to draw funny cartoon faces 02"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Next is that you draw two round shapes for the eyes, and each of them should have a smaller round or dot (for the pupil), which is above the nose. This eye can be in the shape of any of the following;</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Two large circles</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> An ovals</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> A curvy “M,” like the one you can see in the “McDonalds” logo.</p>

                      alt="how to draw funny cartoon faces 03"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> You can draw the mouth just below the nose and draw any of the shapes from the list given below. In addition, to make the mouth funnier, you should then add teeth by either drawing a small square sticking out inside the mouth from the upper side, at the roof of the mouth, or a straight horizontal line which is across the mouth and several vertical lines used to form a grid having two rows and many columns.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> A U-shaped curve that is large</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> A triangle like a right-angled one which is most preferred</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> A circle or an oval shape</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> A rectangle shapes</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> A straight line shapes</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> You can add any other “extra fittings” such as the ears (in cartoons, ears generally considered to be ‘extra’), wrinkles, collar, hat, hair, etc.</p>

<p>Read this article on how to draw the perfect cartoon character yourself:</p>
<p>Step 1: The first is to have an idea of what you want to draw, i.e., the picture you want to draw. You can pick any character to draw from your favorite website or WeeWorld.com.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> First, you draw the face but make sure you don’t add a nose but do a black outline.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Next, you can draw the other features but make sure you don’t use colored pencils. Only use your main writing utensil.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Then, remember to use your imagination to add the clothes and hairstyle.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Finally, you can delete any unwanted lines and color with artist utensils, such as crayons, paintbrushes, colored pencils, etc. Also, remember that you can add some detail to your character to make it pop out and be beautiful.</p>

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 01"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now you have officially made your cartoon, how does it feel?</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 02"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Next, you want to go back and draw again, but this time, not an imitation.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-do-funny-cartoon-drawings-10.png"
                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 03"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Pick up a new piece of paper to be used to draw another character. But this time, you need to change the features. You can decide to make the eyes bigger, neon skin, and maybe crazy hair. You can try clothes that you would love to wear, or ones you wish you could get. Also, try to change the size around to make the features look different and add a nose, and then you can finally color your creation.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 04"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Now, you can compare the two drawings to notice the difference. You will realize that one is an imitation while the other is all you! Now, you can grab a new piece of notebook paper.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 05"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Next is that you begin to jot down different ideas. For example, you may want to draw a cute little puppy or a cute baby. Sometimes you can decide that your cartoon could be about a talking apple or something different.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 06"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Grab another piece of paper and draw any other character you can imagine. You can try using a Sharpie marker for the outline by carefully tracing the pencil. Then you can erase any stray marks on the piece of paper. Next, you can also use any writing utensils like markers, crayons, colored pencils, pastels, or even paint, as it also works well.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 07"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 8:</strong> You can grab your notebook sheet again and then jot down any idea of a comic series. Also, make a plot or funny lines that you could use or any other characters.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 08"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 9:</strong> Next, you fold the blank sheet of paper and make it into about four lines. And then you can draw your main character by just using a pencil first.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 09"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 10:</strong> You can then draw the other characters and all the basic outlines in the drawing.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 10"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 11:</strong> Next is that you can draw the furniture and background, such as trees or anything else, to beautify your drawing.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 11"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 12:</strong> You can go back and add details and outline with Sharpie or black marker and delete any stray marks. You can also color if wanted.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 12"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 13:</strong> Next is for you to add dialogue and actively work with your character drawing.</p>
<p><img

<h3 id="1-Shoujo-Tsubaki-Banned-Everywhere）"><a href="#1-Shoujo-Tsubaki-Banned-Everywhere）" class="headerlink" title="1. Shoujo Tsubaki (Banned Everywhere）"></a>1. Shoujo Tsubaki (Banned Everywhere）</h3><p>It has a very dark, depressing, and intense storyline and it is considered one of the most controversial anime movies ever. This is a 1992 anime film about a young girl whose mother dies. The girl meets a man who tells her he will help her if she ever needs anything. So, after her mother’s death, she goes to find the man and ends up at a circus where she gets abused and raped. Thus, Shoujo Tsubaki is about child sexual abuse with unbearable gore scenes. The horrific and disturbing visuals of this anime have left many viewers traumatized – so much so that the tapes of this film were also destroyed. Therefore, Shoujo Tsubaki is banned almost everywhere, including Japan itself.</p>

Osomatsu-San (Banned in Japan)</h3><p>Osomatsu-San is banned in Japan due to copyright issues. The series’ first episode had parodies of famous anime shows including Attack on Titan, Naruto, Sailor Moon, Dragon Ball Z, and more. Thus, due to copyright, the show’s first episode was removed from airing. It is still not available on mainstream anime websites. You can find the DVD version of the show, but even those do not have the first episode.</p>

<h3 id="3-Excel-Saga-Banned-in-Japan"><a href="#3-Excel-Saga-Banned-in-Japan" class="headerlink" title="3. Excel Saga (Banned in Japan)"></a>3. Excel Saga (Banned in Japan)</h3><p>Excel Saga is based on a popular manga of the same name. It is about a secret ideological organization whose purpose is world domination. The entire Excel Saga is available to watch except for its last episode, called “Going Too Far” – very fitting indeed. It is even banned in its home country, Japan. The reason why this episode got banned is that it’s too long, violent, pornographic, and offensive. Fun fact: The Director of the show, Shinichi Watanabe, purposely got the last episode banned to make it daring and unforgettable. The last episode of Excel Saga is only available on DVD.</p>

<h3 id="4-Death-Note-Banned-in-China"><a href="#4-Death-Note-Banned-in-China" class="headerlink" title="4. Death Note (Banned in China)"></a>4. Death Note (Banned in China)</h3><p>Death note is one of the most famous anime shows ever and while it’s gruesome, bloody and horrific, it is easily available on mainstream platforms, including Netflix. However, there is still a country that did not appreciate the dark premise of this show. Death Note is banned in China due to its theme. The show is about death, justice, murder and violence so it is considered as a corrupting influence on kids.</p>

Attack on Titan (Banned in China)</h3><p>Another cult-favorite anime on the lists is Attack on Titan. Due to its bloody, disgusting and disturbing visuals, it has been banned in China. While millions of viewers love this anime, China thinks this show portrays a lot of excessive violence which is very unhealthy for the younger audience. With that being said, if you are 18 and above, do not miss out on Attack on Titan. It is truly one of the best anime out there!</p>

<h3 id="6-High-School-DxD-Banned-in-New-Zealand"><a href="#6-High-School-DxD-Banned-in-New-Zealand" class="headerlink" title="6. High School DxD (Banned in New Zealand)"></a>6. High School DxD (Banned in New Zealand)</h3><p>With very high viewer ratings, it’s a bit of shock to see this show on the list. High School DxD follows the story of Issei Hyodo, a perverted high school kid who is killed on his very first date. But he gets reincarnated by Rias Gremory as a demon. Now, how come a show about angles and demons gets banned? Well, the premise of the show focuses on corrupt high school kids with a perverted mindset. This show is very sexual and shows a lot of nudity in certain scenes. This is why New Zealand has banned High School DxD for its sexual, harem themes based around high school kids.</p>

Puni Puny Poemy (Banned in New Zealand)</h3><p>Puni Puny Poemy sounds super cute and childish but don’t let the name fool you. Puni <em>Puny Poemy</em> is a spin-off inspired by Excel Saga – no wonder is it banned. This anime has a lot of sexual content surrounding very young characters. The nudity, explicit sexual scenes and harem inspired content is what makes this show so questionable. Thus, it is banned in New Zealand for being overly vulgar and sexual for young viewers. The show does not have a high viewership such as popular titles like Death Note or Attack on Titan, so many countries ignored it.</p>

Hetalia: Axis Powers (Banned in South Korea)</h3><p>Every character in this show represents a country and the role they played in World War II. Even though it is a comedy anime, it offended a few countries. South Korea actually banned the show on the grounds of “offensive stereotypes” and was called a “national crime” by the country. Hetalia: Axis Powers continued to air, the character and all the references to South Korea were completely removed due to backlash. The censored version of this anime is still available in some parts of the country.</p>

Pokémon (Banned in Saudi Arabia)</h3><p>Pokemon banned? Pokemon is perhaps <em>THE</em> most famous and innocent anime ever. It’s kid friendly and super clean. So, why is a show about Satoshi and his pocket monster banned? The religious authorities of Saudi Arabia declared that Pokemon promotes gambling and Jewish sentiments. Since then, there have been many conspiracy theories revolving around the show claiming it to be a Zionist conspiracy. Thus, it is banned in Saudi Arabia. Crazy right?</p>

Kite (Banned in Norway)</h3><p>Kite follows the story of a girl who uses bullets to kill people and make them explode. Now, you must be thinking that the violent nature of the show got it banned in Norway. Nope! not the case. Kite is banned in Norway due to a very graphic sexual assault scene on a minor. Norway has very strict laws against child pornography, thus the entire anime got banned. Similarly, the United States also censored and removed certain parts of the movie but it is not banned there.</p>

<h3 id="1-Shoujo-Tsubaki-Banned-Everywhere）-1"><a href="#1-Shoujo-Tsubaki-Banned-Everywhere）-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Shoujo Tsubaki (Banned Everywhere）"></a>1. Shoujo Tsubaki (Banned Everywhere）</h3><p>It has a very dark, depressing, and intense storyline and it is considered one of the most controversial anime movies ever. This is a 1992 anime film about a young girl whose mother dies. The girl meets a man who tells her he will help her if she ever needs anything. So, after her mother’s death, she goes to find the man and ends up at a circus where she gets abused and raped. Thus, Shoujo Tsubaki is about child sexual abuse with unbearable gore scenes. The horrific and disturbing visuals of this anime have left many viewers traumatized – so much so that the tapes of this film were also destroyed. Therefore, Shoujo Tsubaki is banned almost everywhere, including Japan itself.</p>

Osomatsu-San (Banned in Japan)</h3><p>Osomatsu-San is banned in Japan due to copyright issues. The series’ first episode had parodies of famous anime shows including Attack on Titan, Naruto, Sailor Moon, Dragon Ball Z, and more. Thus, due to copyright, the show’s first episode was removed from airing. It is still not available on mainstream anime websites. You can find the DVD version of the show, but even those do not have the first episode.</p>

<h3 id="3-Excel-Saga-Banned-in-Japan-1"><a href="#3-Excel-Saga-Banned-in-Japan-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Excel Saga (Banned in Japan)"></a>3. Excel Saga (Banned in Japan)</h3><p>Excel Saga is based on a popular manga of the same name. It is about a secret ideological organization whose purpose is world domination. The entire Excel Saga is available to watch except for its last episode, called “Going Too Far” – very fitting indeed. It is even banned in its home country, Japan. The reason why this episode got banned is that it’s too long, violent, pornographic, and offensive. Fun fact: The Director of the show, Shinichi Watanabe, purposely got the last episode banned to make it daring and unforgettable. The last episode of Excel Saga is only available on DVD.</p>

<h3 id="4-Death-Note-Banned-in-China-1"><a href="#4-Death-Note-Banned-in-China-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Death Note (Banned in China)"></a>4. Death Note (Banned in China)</h3><p>Death note is one of the most famous anime shows ever and while it’s gruesome, bloody and horrific, it is easily available on mainstream platforms, including Netflix. However, there is still a country that did not appreciate the dark premise of this show. Death Note is banned in China due to its theme. The show is about death, justice, murder and violence so it is considered as a corrupting influence on kids.</p>

Attack on Titan (Banned in China)</h3><p>Another cult-favorite anime on the lists is Attack on Titan. Due to its bloody, disgusting and disturbing visuals, it has been banned in China. While millions of viewers love this anime, China thinks this show portrays a lot of excessive violence which is very unhealthy for the younger audience. With that being said, if you are 18 and above, do not miss out on Attack on Titan. It is truly one of the best anime out there!</p>

High School DxD (Banned in New Zealand)</h3><p>With very high viewer ratings, it’s a bit of shock to see this show on the list. High School DxD follows the story of Issei Hyodo, a perverted high school kid who is killed on his very first date. But he gets reincarnated by Rias Gremory as a demon. Now, how come a show about angles and demons gets banned? Well, the premise of the show focuses on corrupt high school kids with a perverted mindset. This show is very sexual and shows a lot of nudity in certain scenes. This is why New Zealand has banned High School DxD for its sexual, harem themes based around high school kids.</p>

Puni Puny Poemy (Banned in New Zealand)</h3><p>Puni Puny Poemy sounds super cute and childish but don’t let the name fool you. Puni <em>Puny Poemy</em> is a spin-off inspired by Excel Saga – no wonder is it banned. This anime has a lot of sexual content surrounding very young characters. The nudity, explicit sexual scenes and harem inspired content is what makes this show so questionable. Thus, it is banned in New Zealand for being overly vulgar and sexual for young viewers. The show does not have a high viewership such as popular titles like Death Note or Attack on Titan, so many countries ignored it.</p>

Hetalia: Axis Powers (Banned in South Korea)</h3><p>Every character in this show represents a country and the role they played in World War II. Even though it is a comedy anime, it offended a few countries. South Korea actually banned the show on the grounds of “offensive stereotypes” and was called a “national crime” by the country. Hetalia: Axis Powers continued to air, the character and all the references to South Korea were completely removed due to backlash. The censored version of this anime is still available in some parts of the country.</p>

Pokémon (Banned in Saudi Arabia)</h3><p>Pokemon banned? Pokemon is perhaps <em>THE</em> most famous and innocent anime ever. It’s kid friendly and super clean. So, why is a show about Satoshi and his pocket monster banned? The religious authorities of Saudi Arabia declared that Pokemon promotes gambling and Jewish sentiments. Since then, there have been many conspiracy theories revolving around the show claiming it to be a Zionist conspiracy. Thus, it is banned in Saudi Arabia. Crazy right?</p>

Kite (Banned in Norway)</h3><p>Kite follows the story of a girl who uses bullets to kill people and make them explode. Now, you must be thinking that the violent nature of the show got it banned in Norway. Nope! not the case. Kite is banned in Norway due to a very graphic sexual assault scene on a minor. Norway has very strict laws against child pornography, thus the entire anime got banned. Similarly, the United States also censored and removed certain parts of the movie but it is not banned there.</p>

The horrific and disturbing visuals of this anime have left many viewers traumatized – so much so that the tapes of this film were also destroyed. Therefore, Shoujo Tsubaki is banned almost everywhere, including Japan itself.</p>

The series’ first episode had parodies of famous anime shows including Attack on Titan, Naruto, Sailor Moon, Dragon Ball Z, and more. Thus, due to copyright, the show’s first episode was removed from airing. It is still not available on mainstream anime websites. You can find the DVD version of the show, but even those do not have the first episode.</p>

Excel Saga (Banned in Japan)</h3><p>Excel Saga is based on a popular manga of the same name. It is about a secret ideological organization whose purpose is world domination. The entire Excel Saga is available to watch except for its last episode, called “Going Too Far” – very fitting indeed. It is even banned in its home country, Japan. The reason why this episode got banned is that it’s too long, violent, pornographic, and offensive. Fun fact: The Director of the show, Shinichi Watanabe, purposely got the last episode banned to make it daring and unforgettable. The last episode of Excel Saga is only available on DVD.</p>

Death Note (Banned in China)</h3><p>Death note is one of the most famous anime shows ever and while it’s gruesome, bloody and horrific, it is easily available on mainstream platforms, including Netflix. However, there is still a country that did not appreciate the dark premise of this show. Death Note is banned in China due to its theme. The show is about death, justice, murder and violence so it is considered as a corrupting influence on kids.</p>

Attack on Titan (Banned in China)</h3><p>Another cult-favorite anime on the lists is Attack on Titan. Due to its bloody, disgusting and disturbing visuals, it has been banned in China. While millions of viewers love this anime, China thinks this show portrays a lot of excessive violence which is very unhealthy for the younger audience. With that being said, if you are 18 and above, do not miss out on Attack on Titan. It is truly one of the best anime out there!</p>

High School DxD (Banned in New Zealand)</h3><p>With very high viewer ratings, it’s a bit of shock to see this show on the list. High School DxD follows the story of Issei Hyodo, a perverted high school kid who is killed on his very first date. But he gets reincarnated by Rias Gremory as a demon. Now, how come a show about angles and demons gets banned? Well, the premise of the show focuses on corrupt high school kids with a perverted mindset. This show is very sexual and shows a lot of nudity in certain scenes. This is why New Zealand has banned High School DxD for its sexual, harem themes based around high school kids.</p>

Puni Puny Poemy (Banned in New Zealand)</h3><p>Puni Puny Poemy sounds super cute and childish but don’t let the name fool you. Puni <em>Puny Poemy</em> is a spin-off inspired by Excel Saga – no wonder is it banned. This anime has a lot of sexual content surrounding very young characters. The nudity, explicit sexual scenes and harem inspired content is what makes this show so questionable. Thus, it is banned in New Zealand for being overly vulgar and sexual for young viewers. The show does not have a high viewership such as popular titles like Death Note or Attack on Titan, so many countries ignored it.</p>

Hetalia: Axis Powers (Banned in South Korea)</h3><p>Every character in this show represents a country and the role they played in World War II. Even though it is a comedy anime, it offended a few countries. South Korea actually banned the show on the grounds of “offensive stereotypes” and was called a “national crime” by the country. Hetalia: Axis Powers continued to air, the character and all the references to South Korea were completely removed due to backlash. The censored version of this anime is still available in some parts of the country.</p>

So, why is a show about Satoshi and his pocket monster banned? The religious authorities of Saudi Arabia declared that Pokemon promotes gambling and Jewish sentiments. Since then, there have been many conspiracy theories revolving around the show claiming it to be a Zionist conspiracy. Thus, it is banned in Saudi Arabia. Crazy right?</p>

Now, you must be thinking that the violent nature of the show got it banned in Norway. Nope! not the case. Kite is banned in Norway due to a very graphic sexual assault scene on a minor. Norway has very strict laws against child pornography, thus the entire anime got banned. Similarly, the United States also censored and removed certain parts of the movie but it is not banned there.</p>

So, after her mother’s death, she goes to find the man and ends up at a circus where she gets abused and raped. Thus, Shoujo Tsubaki is about child sexual abuse with unbearable gore scenes. The horrific and disturbing visuals of this anime have left many viewers traumatized – so much so that the tapes of this film were also destroyed. Therefore, Shoujo Tsubaki is banned almost everywhere, including Japan itself.</p>

Fun fact: The Director of the show, Shinichi Watanabe, purposely got the last episode banned to make it daring and unforgettable. The last episode of Excel Saga is only available on DVD.</p>

Attack on Titan (Banned in China)</h3><p>Another cult-favorite anime on the lists is Attack on Titan. Due to its bloody, disgusting and disturbing visuals, it has been banned in China. While millions of viewers love this anime, China thinks this show portrays a lot of excessive violence which is very unhealthy for the younger audience. With that being said, if you are 18 and above, do not miss out on Attack on Titan. It is truly one of the best anime out there!</p>

High School DxD (Banned in New Zealand)</h3><p>With very high viewer ratings, it’s a bit of shock to see this show on the list. High School DxD follows the story of Issei Hyodo, a perverted high school kid who is killed on his very first date. But he gets reincarnated by Rias Gremory as a demon. Now, how come a show about angles and demons gets banned? Well, the premise of the show focuses on corrupt high school kids with a perverted mindset. This show is very sexual and shows a lot of nudity in certain scenes. This is why New Zealand has banned High School DxD for its sexual, harem themes based around high school kids.</p>

Puni Puny Poemy (Banned in New Zealand)</h3><p>Puni Puny Poemy sounds super cute and childish but don’t let the name fool you. Puni <em>Puny Poemy</em> is a spin-off inspired by Excel Saga – no wonder is it banned. This anime has a lot of sexual content surrounding very young characters. The nudity, explicit sexual scenes and harem inspired content is what makes this show so questionable. Thus, it is banned in New Zealand for being overly vulgar and sexual for young viewers. The show does not have a high viewership such as popular titles like Death Note or Attack on Titan, so many countries ignored it.</p>

Hetalia: Axis Powers (Banned in South Korea)</h3><p>Every character in this show represents a country and the role they played in World War II. Even though it is a comedy anime, it offended a few countries. South Korea actually banned the show on the grounds of “offensive stereotypes” and was called a “national crime” by the country. Hetalia: Axis Powers continued to air, the character and all the references to South Korea were completely removed due to backlash. The censored version of this anime is still available in some parts of the country.</p>

So, why is a show about Satoshi and his pocket monster banned? The religious authorities of Saudi Arabia declared that Pokemon promotes gambling and Jewish sentiments. Since then, there have been many conspiracy theories revolving around the show claiming it to be a Zionist conspiracy. Thus, it is banned in Saudi Arabia. Crazy right?</p>

Kite (Banned in Norway)</h3><p>Kite follows the story of a girl who uses bullets to kill people and make them explode. Now, you must be thinking that the violent nature of the show got it banned in Norway. Nope! not the case. Kite is banned in Norway due to a very graphic sexual assault scene on a minor. Norway has very strict laws against child pornography, thus the entire anime got banned. Similarly, the United States also censored and removed certain parts of the movie but it is not banned there.</p>
