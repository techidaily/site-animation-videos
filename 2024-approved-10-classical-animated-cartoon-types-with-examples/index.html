Along with that, the funny cartoon was known for the ingenuity and creative character names like Doug Funnie, Patti Mayonnaise, Skeeter, Porkchop, Tippi Dink, Roger Klotz, and Mosquito Valentine.</p>

<p>Canva has become a buzzword in the designing and animation world. It’s a graphic design platform that allows users to create graphic designs for social media, for presentations, documents, cards for any memorable occasion. It was founded by Melanie Perkins, an Australian technology entrepreneur.</p>
<p>It allows users to work individually or across teams. With real-time live changes made available, Canva is pushing the boundary of what is possible and making it more accessible. With the introduction of animated elements in Canva, the possibilities for design horizons have expanded significantly.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Animate-An-Element-In-Canva"><a href="#Part-2-Animate-An-Element-In-Canva" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Animate An Element In Canva"></a>Part 2 Animate An Element In Canva</h2><p>There are one of two ways to go about creating an animation. You can work off an existing template or create a custom template. If you’re wondering how to animate individual elements in Canva then this guide is for you.</p>
<p>The first step to animation is building your custom static design. For that you need to go to Canva and select “Create a Design” option. Once you do, select the type of content you’re attempting to create- from Instagram posts to a presentation or an A4 document.</p>
<p>Think of the text font you’re going to use.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Canva image editor"
                ></p>
<p>Then you should look into adding elements that suit your text on the design.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Animated elements Canva"
                ></p>
<p>You can upload photographs into your creation with the upload button. This also extends to uploading audio that you want to use on video clips.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Adding pictures to Canva image editor"
                ></p>
<p>Once you’re done with these steps, you should have a customized static design that you can use. Let’s now look at how to animate individual elements in Canva. These elements are the text, the image, audio, and video.</p>
<h3 id="2-1-Image"><a href="#2-1-Image" class="headerlink" title="2.1 Image"></a>2.1 Image</h3><p>To add an image to Canva, you need to upload it in the ‘Upload’ tab on Canva. Once you do, the image can then be selected for display on your presentation.</p>
<p>For images, you can also choose to frame them within the “elements” tab. There are two kinds of elements. One which allows photographs to be embedded in them and ones which don’t. You can choose any element as a frame for your embedded image.</p>
<p>The next thing is to choose the “Animate” button. This will open up different options for animation features. The animate button allows a preview of what each animation does in real-time.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

<h3 id="2-2-Text"><a href="#2-2-Text" class="headerlink" title="2.2 Text"></a>2.2 Text</h3><p>Add in the text you want to see to the image. The text can be in any style that you choose. Canva offers a variety of fonts that you can use to customize the color, size, and duration of the display.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

You have the option of adding videos to Canva as well. Just load the video you have on hand to the Canva “Uploads” section. Introduce the video clip to the design.</p>
<p>Another way to embed the video is by using an element and embedding your video within it.</p>
<p>With video, you also have options like cropping, adjusting the playback. With playback, you can choose “Autoplay Video” and “Loop Video.” These are basic options for how the video can be played. The crop function allows you to trim the video to any point in time.</p>
<p>On top of this, you can use the animate button, which can create options for how the video is introduced to the backdrop.</p>

                      alt="Canva playback animations"
                ></p>
<p>If you want to remove the animation, you need to go to the “Animate” button and select the ‘None’ option to delete the animation from the design.</p>
<p>You can opt to animate either just the elements or you can animate the slide on the whole with “Page Animations.”</p>

This is because the presentation only lasts the duration of the video.</p>

<p>Canva has become a buzzword in the designing and animation world. It’s a graphic design platform that allows users to create graphic designs for social media, for presentations, documents, cards for any memorable occasion. It was founded by Melanie Perkins, an Australian technology entrepreneur.</p>
<p>It allows users to work individually or across teams. With real-time live changes made available, Canva is pushing the boundary of what is possible and making it more accessible. With the introduction of animated elements in Canva, the possibilities for design horizons have expanded significantly.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Animate-An-Element-In-Canva-2"><a href="#Part-2-Animate-An-Element-In-Canva-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Animate An Element In Canva"></a>Part 2 Animate An Element In Canva</h2><p>There are one of two ways to go about creating an animation. You can work off an existing template or create a custom template. If you’re wondering how to animate individual elements in Canva then this guide is for you.</p>
<p>The first step to animation is building your custom static design. For that you need to go to Canva and select “Create a Design” option. Once you do, select the type of content you’re attempting to create- from Instagram posts to a presentation or an A4 document.</p>
<p>Think of the text font you’re going to use.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Canva image editor"
                ></p>
<p>Then you should look into adding elements that suit your text on the design.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Animated elements Canva"
                ></p>
<p>You can upload photographs into your creation with the upload button. This also extends to uploading audio that you want to use on video clips.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Adding pictures to Canva image editor"
                ></p>
<p>Once you’re done with these steps, you should have a customized static design that you can use. Let’s now look at how to animate individual elements in Canva. These elements are the text, the image, audio, and video.</p>
<h3 id="2-1-Image-2"><a href="#2-1-Image-2" class="headerlink" title="2.1 Image"></a>2.1 Image</h3><p>To add an image to Canva, you need to upload it in the ‘Upload’ tab on Canva. Once you do, the image can then be selected for display on your presentation.</p>
<p>For images, you can also choose to frame them within the “elements” tab. There are two kinds of elements. One which allows photographs to be embedded in them and ones which don’t. You can choose any element as a frame for your embedded image.</p>
<p>The next thing is to choose the “Animate” button. This will open up different options for animation features. The animate button allows a preview of what each animation does in real-time.</p>

<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-make-a-photoshop-collage-in-easy-steps-4.jpg"
                      alt="new option photoshop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 4: Add the selected images one-by-one</strong></p>
<p>Adding the images can be done in many ways. One way to do so is by opening the photo and clicking on it. Another way of doing so is to use the “Marquee Tool” of Photoshop.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="marquee tool photoshop"
                ></p>
<p>Another way of doing so is by pressing the “ctrl” and “A” keys on your keyboard together. You will find the matching ants border around the image when you do this.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-make-a-photoshop-collage-in-easy-steps-6.jpg"
                      alt="add image"
                ></p>
<p>Then, go to the “Edit” option and choose “Copy” there. Or, you can also select the “ctrl” and “C” keys on your keywords together. Then go to your new document and select the option of “Paste” from the “Edit” option, or you can also press the “ctrl” and “V” keys together to do so.</p>
<p>The photo will be added in its own layer on the new document.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-make-a-photoshop-collage-in-easy-steps-7.jpg"
                      alt="edit image photoshop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 5: Arrange the images</strong></p>
<p>Now, arrange the images in the way you want. If you have chosen to tell a story through your <strong>collage creator in photoshop</strong>, then arrange the photos accordingly. You can do so with the help of the “Move” tool or simply tap V. You can also use the “Free Transform” tool to edit and transform the images in the way you want. You can resize, rotate and edit the photos in many other ways through the “Free Transform” tool.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6: Integrate image space</strong></p>
<p>To <strong>create a collage in photoshop</strong> in a better and more spaced-out manner, you need to add some spacing between the images you have in your collage. There are two ways to add spacing between the pictures; one way is by creating a thin, white border around each image.</p>
<p>And the second method is by accessing and using the “Layers” feature in Photoshop.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="add layer"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 7: Merge all the Layers</strong></p>
<p>This step is necessary when you have used the “Layer” feature to create the spacing among the images present in your collage. You will be able to do so from the “Layer” option. So, go to the “Layer” option and select the “Merge Invisible” option present there.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="merge layer photoshop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 8: cropping the final picture</strong></p>
<p>Before the final step, it is important that you crop the final picture. And to do so, you can opt for the “Crop tool”. You will be able to access it easily, or you can also simply tap C to use the “Crop tool.”</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="crop photo photoshop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 9: Save the final collage and export</strong></p>
<p>After you have done all the necessary changes and are satisfied with the final collage, then, save the file. To do so, go to the “File” option and select the “Save as” option.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="save image photoshop"
                ></p>
<p>Then choose the file type to be “JPEG”. Type the name you would want the collage to be saved as. This completes the process of saving the file. Then choose the image quality you would want the collage to be exported in.</p>

Then, click on the “New” option. It will help you make a new file for your collage. You can also select the “ctrl” and “N” together.</p>
<p>As you click on the “New” option, you will be given options to choose from. Choose the one that matches your preference.</p>
<p>When you are working on photoshop to make a collage, the images will need a collage background because it is on this background that the photos will assemble. If you have made a collage before on photoshop, you can use the old <strong>collage photoshop template</strong>. Otherwise, you need to create a new document for the collage.</p>

                      alt="new option photoshop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 4: Add the selected images one-by-one</strong></p>
<p>Adding the images can be done in many ways. One way to do so is by opening the photo and clicking on it. Another way of doing so is to use the “Marquee Tool” of Photoshop.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="marquee tool photoshop"
                ></p>
<p>Another way of doing so is by pressing the “ctrl” and “A” keys on your keyboard together. You will find the matching ants border around the image when you do this.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-make-a-photoshop-collage-in-easy-steps-6.jpg"
                      alt="add image"
                ></p>
<p>Then, go to the “Edit” option and choose “Copy” there. Or, you can also select the “ctrl” and “C” keys on your keywords together. Then go to your new document and select the option of “Paste” from the “Edit” option, or you can also press the “ctrl” and “V” keys together to do so.</p>
<p>The photo will be added in its own layer on the new document.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="edit image photoshop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 5: Arrange the images</strong></p>
<p>Now, arrange the images in the way you want. If you have chosen to tell a story through your <strong>collage creator in photoshop</strong>, then arrange the photos accordingly. You can do so with the help of the “Move” tool or simply tap V. You can also use the “Free Transform” tool to edit and transform the images in the way you want. You can resize, rotate and edit the photos in many other ways through the “Free Transform” tool.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6: Integrate image space</strong></p>
<p>To <strong>create a collage in photoshop</strong> in a better and more spaced-out manner, you need to add some spacing between the images you have in your collage. There are two ways to add spacing between the pictures; one way is by creating a thin, white border around each image.</p>
<p>And the second method is by accessing and using the “Layers” feature in Photoshop.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="add layer"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 7: Merge all the Layers</strong></p>
<p>This step is necessary when you have used the “Layer” feature to create the spacing among the images present in your collage. You will be able to do so from the “Layer” option. So, go to the “Layer” option and select the “Merge Invisible” option present there.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="merge layer photoshop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 8: cropping the final picture</strong></p>
<p>Before the final step, it is important that you crop the final picture. And to do so, you can opt for the “Crop tool”. You will be able to access it easily, or you can also simply tap C to use the “Crop tool.”</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="crop photo photoshop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 9: Save the final collage and export</strong></p>
<p>After you have done all the necessary changes and are satisfied with the final collage, then, save the file. To do so, go to the “File” option and select the “Save as” option.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="save image photoshop"
                ></p>
<p>Then choose the file type to be “JPEG”. Type the name you would want the collage to be saved as. This completes the process of saving the file. Then choose the image quality you would want the collage to be exported in.</p>

<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-make-a-photoshop-collage-in-easy-steps-4.jpg"
                      alt="new option photoshop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 4: Add the selected images one-by-one</strong></p>
<p>Adding the images can be done in many ways. One way to do so is by opening the photo and clicking on it. Another way of doing so is to use the “Marquee Tool” of Photoshop.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-make-a-photoshop-collage-in-easy-steps-5.jpg"
                      alt="marquee tool photoshop"
                ></p>
<p>Another way of doing so is by pressing the “ctrl” and “A” keys on your keyboard together. You will find the matching ants border around the image when you do this.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-make-a-photoshop-collage-in-easy-steps-6.jpg"
                      alt="add image"
                ></p>
<p>Then, go to the “Edit” option and choose “Copy” there. Or, you can also select the “ctrl” and “C” keys on your keywords together. Then go to your new document and select the option of “Paste” from the “Edit” option, or you can also press the “ctrl” and “V” keys together to do so.</p>
<p>The photo will be added in its own layer on the new document.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-make-a-photoshop-collage-in-easy-steps-7.jpg"
                      alt="edit image photoshop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 5: Arrange the images</strong></p>
<p>Now, arrange the images in the way you want. If you have chosen to tell a story through your <strong>collage creator in photoshop</strong>, then arrange the photos accordingly. You can do so with the help of the “Move” tool or simply tap V. You can also use the “Free Transform” tool to edit and transform the images in the way you want. You can resize, rotate and edit the photos in many other ways through the “Free Transform” tool.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6: Integrate image space</strong></p>
<p>To <strong>create a collage in photoshop</strong> in a better and more spaced-out manner, you need to add some spacing between the images you have in your collage. There are two ways to add spacing between the pictures; one way is by creating a thin, white border around each image.</p>
<p>And the second method is by accessing and using the “Layers” feature in Photoshop.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-make-a-photoshop-collage-in-easy-steps-8.jpg"
                      alt="add layer"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 7: Merge all the Layers</strong></p>
<p>This step is necessary when you have used the “Layer” feature to create the spacing among the images present in your collage. You will be able to do so from the “Layer” option. So, go to the “Layer” option and select the “Merge Invisible” option present there.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="merge layer photoshop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 8: cropping the final picture</strong></p>
<p>Before the final step, it is important that you crop the final picture. And to do so, you can opt for the “Crop tool”. You will be able to access it easily, or you can also simply tap C to use the “Crop tool.”</p>

                      alt="crop photo photoshop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 9: Save the final collage and export</strong></p>
<p>After you have done all the necessary changes and are satisfied with the final collage, then, save the file. To do so, go to the “File” option and select the “Save as” option.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-make-a-photoshop-collage-in-easy-steps-11.jpg"
                      alt="save image photoshop"
