<p><strong>●</strong> Take Care of the File Size</p>
<p>The credibility of LinkedIn carousel posts lies in the engaging presentation of your static and monotonous text to make them stand out of the crowded newsfeed. True that your creative skills are sufficient enough to design a graphic masterpiece, yet you should take care to remain within an affordable limit, lest you would end up with a large file that gets difficult to upload and process. Most reliably, a 100 MB file size would easily fit into the bill.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Restrict Your Slide Count</p>
<p>When creating a <strong>slideshow LinkedIn</strong> presentation, it is normal to get a bit over the line while including the most exemplary and comprehensive details about your professional qualifications, skills and background. Relax, that’s nothing wrong! However, all you need to care about is limiting the slide count of your slideshow to a maximum of 300 pages. As a genuine approach, no one would bother going beyond that to read about you anyway!</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Use a Commendable File Format</p>
<p>You would ideally want the documents and media files in your slideshow to have the finest quality. LinkedIn allows you to create and share your graphic presentations in the PDF, DOCX, DOC, PPTX and PPT file formats. If you want the assurance of your slideshows having the highest resolution and appreciable output quality, it is recommended to save them in the PDF file format.</p>

<p>Optionally, you can also create GIFs from video files, but you should keep in mind that the sound is going to be removed automatically, as GIF files cannot contain audio.</p>

Is It Possible To Create Gifs From An Android Device?"></a>1. Is It Possible To Create Gifs From An Android Device?</h4><p>Recording a GIF with a camera on an Android phone is not possible unless you install a third-party app. There a lot of GIF apps for Android to choose from that enable you to create GIFs directly from your phone.</p>
<p>GIF Camera, GIF Maker or GIF Creator are just a few among countless apps that allow Android users to make GIFs, although some of them place limits on the maximum duration of a GIF. In addition, most of these apps are equipped with filters and effects that can be easily applied to a GIF.</p>
<h4 id="2-How-To-Add-Text-To-A-GIF-From-An-Android-Phone-3"><a href="#2-How-To-Add-Text-To-A-GIF-From-An-Android-Phone-3" class="headerlink" title="2. How To Add Text To A GIF From An Android Phone?"></a>2. How To Add Text To A GIF From An Android Phone?</h4><p>In case the app you are using to record a GIF with an Android phone doesn’t offer text tools you will have to use a video editing app to add text to a GIF you created. However, most GIF apps are equipped with at least basic text editing tools that enable you to apply text layers over the animated GIFs you create with them.</p>
<p>After you launch a GIF app and record a new GIF, you can use the text tool to insert the text you want to include in a GIF and to adjust its position, size, or color.</p>

Why Can’t I Preview Gifs On My Android Phone?"></a>3. Why Can’t I Preview Gifs On My Android Phone?</h4><p>Android OS has had compatibility issues with GIF files for years, as nearly all versions of the OS don’t offer native support for GIFs. In case you are having trouble previewing a GIF file from an Android device, you should try restarting it in order to make sure that some unrelated issue isn’t causing the lagging.</p>
<p>If the issue persists, you should update the OS to Android 7.1 or later, because previous versions of the OS may experience difficulties displaying GIF files.</p>

He happens to be Moana’s best friend. Pua made his first appearance during the ‘Where you are’ performance alongside the village chief’s daughter. On Moana’s first attempt at setting sails to find Maui, their raft gets damaged, and Pua becomes scared of the sea and Moana’s oar. Later on, the makers removed the adorable pig to allow Moana to strive more independently. However, this indeed came with many critics from fans as Pua was just too sweet and cute. As much as Pua’s role in the film was small, he still made a lot of impressions.</p>

Before the 2016 classic, we first meet Dory in the 2003 Pixar’s classic ‘finding Nemo’ where Dory helps Marlin, a clownfish, reunites with his son, Nemo. In ‘Finding Dory, ‘ young Dory’s amnesiac was finally brought back thirteen years later. Dory is perseverant, has a trim physique, and yet she can do whatever she has set her mind to do.</p>

He happens to be Moana’s best friend. Pua made his first appearance during the ‘Where you are’ performance alongside the village chief’s daughter. On Moana’s first attempt at setting sails to find Maui, their raft gets damaged, and Pua becomes scared of the sea and Moana’s oar. Later on, the makers removed the adorable pig to allow Moana to strive more independently. However, this indeed came with many critics from fans as Pua was just too sweet and cute. As much as Pua’s role in the film was small, he still made a lot of impressions.</p>

<p>You have to be free with yourself and try to create <strong>cartoon sketch drawings</strong> of characters that you love.</p>
<p>The more it’s about something you love, the better you get at it.</p>
<p>Here’s a step-by-step process of an easy pencil drawing or <strong>sketch cartoon drawing.</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 1: Draw a circle</strong></p>
<p>Draw a circle and a “noodle” shape, as shown in the illustration. The head is a circle, and the body is a pear form.</p>
<p>The lower half of the pear is fatter than the top. Take note of how the upper half slightly overlaps the head circle.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-09.jpg"
                      alt="draw a circle"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 2: Draw a pair of eyes.</strong></p>
<p>As shown in the image, add the perspective guidelines around the head. These recommendations will assist you in correctly positioning your rabbit’s eyes and nose.</p>
<p>Above the horizontal guideline, draw the eyes. Where the parameters cross is where the nose is put.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-10.jpg"
                      alt="draw the eyes"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 3: Draw the cheek and Wings</strong></p>
<p>Make the cheekbones. As shown in the illustration, add the ears and arms. It’s OK if the ear shapes differ somewhat from those displayed.</p>
<p>Notice how the arm contour curve organically emerges from behind the shoulders when you sketch the arms. Make it this way if you can.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-11.jpg"
                      alt="draw the cheeks and wings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 4: Draw the legs</strong></p>
<p>Draw the legs and tail of the animal. The arm and leg curves may appear to be challenging. As a result, be gentle with your pencil. Don’t yank on the pencil too hard!</p>
<p>Your cartoon rabbit’s shape is now plainly evident.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-12.jpg"
                      alt="draw the legs"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 5: Draw the mouth</strong></p>
<p>Let’s focus on the face for a moment. Draw an iris ellipse and an inner line in the ear inside the eyes. Include the nose. Draw the mouth and the teeth.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-13.jpg"
                      alt="draw the mouth"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 6: Outline the contours</strong></p>
<p>Because rabbits eat carrots, this one eats them in excess. Outline the carrot’s outlines. On the legs, draw the brows and the fingers.</p>
<p>As you may have observed, I messed up the teeth in the previous image. Therefore I deleted the thick black pencil lines that were superfluous.</p>
<p>Erase and Shade (Step 8)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-14.jpg"
                      alt="outline the contours"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 7: Outline the Character</strong></p>
<p>Now, outline the contours of the entire character with a softer pencil. You can pick up B4 or B6 (if you don’t have either, try HB). Please leave a little bright dot on the nose while darkening it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-15.jpg"
                      alt="outline the character"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 8: Erase and Shade</strong></p>
<p>Remove everything that isn’t required. See? That is how your bunny should seem.</p>
<p>I also advocate using a pencil-type eraser in addition to regular or kneaded erasers. Shade the entire rabbit’s body if you’re using a graphite pencil. The inside of the ear, the belly, the paws, and the tail can all be white or brighter.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<p>You have to be free with yourself and try to create <strong>cartoon sketch drawings</strong> of characters that you love.</p>
<p>The more it’s about something you love, the better you get at it.</p>
<p>Here’s a step-by-step process of an easy pencil drawing or <strong>sketch cartoon drawing.</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 1: Draw a circle</strong></p>
<p>Draw a circle and a “noodle” shape, as shown in the illustration. The head is a circle, and the body is a pear form.</p>
<p>The lower half of the pear is fatter than the top. Take note of how the upper half slightly overlaps the head circle.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="draw a circle"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 2: Draw a pair of eyes.</strong></p>
<p>As shown in the image, add the perspective guidelines around the head. These recommendations will assist you in correctly positioning your rabbit’s eyes and nose.</p>
<p>Above the horizontal guideline, draw the eyes. Where the parameters cross is where the nose is put.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-10.jpg"
                      alt="draw the eyes"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 3: Draw the cheek and Wings</strong></p>
<p>Make the cheekbones. As shown in the illustration, add the ears and arms. It’s OK if the ear shapes differ somewhat from those displayed.</p>
<p>Notice how the arm contour curve organically emerges from behind the shoulders when you sketch the arms. Make it this way if you can.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-11.jpg"
                      alt="draw the cheeks and wings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 4: Draw the legs</strong></p>
<p>Draw the legs and tail of the animal. The arm and leg curves may appear to be challenging. As a result, be gentle with your pencil. Don’t yank on the pencil too hard!</p>
<p>Your cartoon rabbit’s shape is now plainly evident.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-12.jpg"
                      alt="draw the legs"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 5: Draw the mouth</strong></p>
<p>Let’s focus on the face for a moment. Draw an iris ellipse and an inner line in the ear inside the eyes. Include the nose. Draw the mouth and the teeth.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-13.jpg"
                      alt="draw the mouth"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 6: Outline the contours</strong></p>
<p>Because rabbits eat carrots, this one eats them in excess. Outline the carrot’s outlines. On the legs, draw the brows and the fingers.</p>
<p>As you may have observed, I messed up the teeth in the previous image. Therefore I deleted the thick black pencil lines that were superfluous.</p>
<p>Erase and Shade (Step 8)</p>

                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="outline the contours"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 7: Outline the Character</strong></p>
<p>Now, outline the contours of the entire character with a softer pencil. You can pick up B4 or B6 (if you don’t have either, try HB). Please leave a little bright dot on the nose while darkening it.</p>

                      alt="outline the character"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 8: Erase and Shade</strong></p>
<p>Remove everything that isn’t required. See? That is how your bunny should seem.</p>
<p>I also advocate using a pencil-type eraser in addition to regular or kneaded erasers. Shade the entire rabbit’s body if you’re using a graphite pencil. The inside of the ear, the belly, the paws, and the tail can all be white or brighter.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 4: Draw the legs</strong></p>
<p>Draw the legs and tail of the animal. The arm and leg curves may appear to be challenging. As a result, be gentle with your pencil. Don’t yank on the pencil too hard!</p>
<p>Your cartoon rabbit’s shape is now plainly evident.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 5: Draw the mouth</strong></p>
<p>Let’s focus on the face for a moment. Draw an iris ellipse and an inner line in the ear inside the eyes. Include the nose. Draw the mouth and the teeth.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 6: Outline the contours</strong></p>
<p>Because rabbits eat carrots, this one eats them in excess. Outline the carrot’s outlines. On the legs, draw the brows and the fingers.</p>
<p>As you may have observed, I messed up the teeth in the previous image. Therefore I deleted the thick black pencil lines that were superfluous.</p>
<p>Erase and Shade (Step 8)</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 7: Outline the Character</strong></p>
<p>Now, outline the contours of the entire character with a softer pencil. You can pick up B4 or B6 (if you don’t have either, try HB). Please leave a little bright dot on the nose while darkening it.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 8: Erase and Shade</strong></p>
<p>Remove everything that isn’t required. See? That is how your bunny should seem.</p>
<p>I also advocate using a pencil-type eraser in addition to regular or kneaded erasers. Shade the entire rabbit’s body if you’re using a graphite pencil. The inside of the ear, the belly, the paws, and the tail can all be white or brighter.</p>

<p>You have to be free with yourself and try to create <strong>cartoon sketch drawings</strong> of characters that you love.</p>
<p>The more it’s about something you love, the better you get at it.</p>
<p>Here’s a step-by-step process of an easy pencil drawing or <strong>sketch cartoon drawing.</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 1: Draw a circle</strong></p>
<p>Draw a circle and a “noodle” shape, as shown in the illustration. The head is a circle, and the body is a pear form.</p>
<p>The lower half of the pear is fatter than the top. Take note of how the upper half slightly overlaps the head circle.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="draw a circle"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 2: Draw a pair of eyes.</strong></p>
<p>As shown in the image, add the perspective guidelines around the head. These recommendations will assist you in correctly positioning your rabbit’s eyes and nose.</p>
<p>Above the horizontal guideline, draw the eyes. Where the parameters cross is where the nose is put.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="draw the eyes"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 3: Draw the cheek and Wings</strong></p>
<p>Make the cheekbones. As shown in the illustration, add the ears and arms. It’s OK if the ear shapes differ somewhat from those displayed.</p>
<p>Notice how the arm contour curve organically emerges from behind the shoulders when you sketch the arms. Make it this way if you can.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 4: Draw the legs</strong></p>
<p>Draw the legs and tail of the animal. The arm and leg curves may appear to be challenging. As a result, be gentle with your pencil. Don’t yank on the pencil too hard!</p>
