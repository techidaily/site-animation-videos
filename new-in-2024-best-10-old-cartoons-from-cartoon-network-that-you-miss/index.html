                      alt="file new blender"
                ></p>
<h5 id="Step-2-3"><a href="#Step-2-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 2"></a>Step 2</h5><p>Now, click on the Grease Pencil tool and use it to draw any shape on the canvas. If you want to add multiple objects to the animation, you can also draw multiple shapes.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<p>Today there is a lot pre-made skeletons you can use and reuse as many times as you want, making only a few minor adjustments to the base design. If your creativity is sparking like firecrackers, then a rig can make it look more defined and&#x2F;or realistic.</p>
<p>Not convinced? Let’s talk more about <strong>Rigging Animation</strong>.</p>

<p>This is called skeleton animation and is a major technique used in creating animated models that give us that 36vibe of the character in movies. It helps animators in controlling its movement just like a puppet. Hidden call back to the Matrix.</p>
<p>What you see in most movies or games, are characters and models who supported by a network of digital mechanical skeletons all rigged to move in a certain way.</p>
<h3 id="02How-Does-Rigging-Work"><a href="#02How-Does-Rigging-Work" class="headerlink" title="02How Does Rigging Work?"></a>02How Does Rigging Work?</h3><p>The process of rigging is usually the second step in a long line of other methods applied after creating a model.</p>
<p>There is a series of interdependent bones that need to be constructed which is representation of the <strong>skeletal structure</strong> which is the basic goal in <strong>rigging animation.</strong></p>
<p>With the right digital animation software you can reposition, repurpose and scale these bones in more ways than one.</p>
<p>The next step would involve recording the different movements of these bones on a timeline. This part of the process is called keyframing in animation.</p>
<p>These simple steps are actually more intricate than they actually are. Each movement acts as trigger to another set of movements like how the shoulder bone is connected to the forearm of our body.</p>
<p>This movement of the model becomes even more realistic once its weight scale has been determined. Painting weight can be considered to be the most unnerving challenge in the entire process.</p>
<p>Which is where Inverse Kinematics can help in making things 5easier by just reversing forward kinematic movements.</p>
<p>All of these aspects of rigging makes it possible to help animation mimic real life movements.</p>
<h3 id="03How-is-Rigging-Used"><a href="#03How-is-Rigging-Used" class="headerlink" title="03How is Rigging Used?"></a>03How is Rigging Used?</h3><p>Rigging is a technique which has only started gaining more prominence in recent times due to how crucial it is to the gaming and animation movie industry.</p>
<p>Not only is it used on characters but all mechanical objects in animations can also be rigged. With the help of a computerized program physicality is added to the bone structure and is recorded through a series of frames. These recording are then played back.</p>
<p>There are other applications to the and modelling process which goes beyond the entertainment industry such as giving virtual medical demonstrations or modeling a product.</p>
<p>This entire process can get much more repetitive and complex when it comes to rigging something as dynamic as the human face.</p>
<h3 id="04Intro-to-Rigging-Software"><a href="#04Intro-to-Rigging-Software" class="headerlink" title="04Intro to Rigging Software"></a>04Intro to Rigging Software</h3><p>You might already be aware by now that there are some major animation software on the market that can provide you with just about every tool you need to make jaw dropping rigger animations.</p>
<p>Software like Blender, Cinema 4D, Maya and Houdini employs fantastic Skeletal Animation and digital motion capturing techniques. They open the doors to more realistic animations that can be used to create far more interactive and personalized digital worlds.</p>
<p>Maya and 3Ds Max is used to do real time animation rigging and is considered by most to be the industry standard by most animators.</p>
<p>Blender on the other hand is a free to use software. Though not quite as strong as Maya, it is an open source software which is equipped with everything you need to rig and animate models.</p>
<p>You can import completed animated files onto game engines and all types of other applications. The most common format for importing animated files is .fbx.</p>

Maya is probably the one software which gives you credit for just knowing it.</p>
<p>Maya has several levels of features you need to practice before you can call yourself a Maya master.</p>
<p>The best way to get your hands practiced on animating on Maya is by becoming well versed with all the stats and proportions while working with rigs. You would surely need to get your hands on high quality rig packages that makes the learning experience even more worth it.</p>
<p>With time, you would get better at understanding of the specifics of building a structure you would be showing in the final result. However getting stuck with the wrong type of rig can end up making your animating experience counterintuitive.</p>
<p>Here is a list of Maya Rigs you can start on right away;</p>

<p>This is called skeleton animation and is a major technique used in creating animated models that give us that 36vibe of the character in movies. It helps animators in controlling its movement just like a puppet. Hidden call back to the Matrix.</p>
<p>What you see in most movies or games, are characters and models who supported by a network of digital mechanical skeletons all rigged to move in a certain way.</p>
<h3 id="02How-Does-Rigging-Work-3"><a href="#02How-Does-Rigging-Work-3" class="headerlink" title="02How Does Rigging Work?"></a>02How Does Rigging Work?</h3><p>The process of rigging is usually the second step in a long line of other methods applied after creating a model.</p>
<p>There is a series of interdependent bones that need to be constructed which is representation of the <strong>skeletal structure</strong> which is the basic goal in <strong>rigging animation.</strong></p>
<p>With the right digital animation software you can reposition, repurpose and scale these bones in more ways than one.</p>
<p>The next step would involve recording the different movements of these bones on a timeline. This part of the process is called keyframing in animation.</p>
<p>These simple steps are actually more intricate than they actually are. Each movement acts as trigger to another set of movements like how the shoulder bone is connected to the forearm of our body.</p>
<p>This movement of the model becomes even more realistic once its weight scale has been determined. Painting weight can be considered to be the most unnerving challenge in the entire process.</p>
<p>Which is where Inverse Kinematics can help in making things 5easier by just reversing forward kinematic movements.</p>
<p>All of these aspects of rigging makes it possible to help animation mimic real life movements.</p>
<h3 id="03How-is-Rigging-Used-3"><a href="#03How-is-Rigging-Used-3" class="headerlink" title="03How is Rigging Used?"></a>03How is Rigging Used?</h3><p>Rigging is a technique which has only started gaining more prominence in recent times due to how crucial it is to the gaming and animation movie industry.</p>
<p>Not only is it used on characters but all mechanical objects in animations can also be rigged. With the help of a computerized program physicality is added to the bone structure and is recorded through a series of frames. These recording are then played back.</p>
<p>There are other applications to the and modelling process which goes beyond the entertainment industry such as giving virtual medical demonstrations or modeling a product.</p>
<p>This entire process can get much more repetitive and complex when it comes to rigging something as dynamic as the human face.</p>

<p>What if you wish to animate images, adding movement to stationary objects in time? Well, there are apps for these purposes!</p>
<p>Videos and GIFs are a mainstay of social media. These days it’s rare to see a still photo online. The simplicity with which you can add filter and movement effects to your images has identified a proliferation of these online animated photos.</p>
<p>So what if you wish to apply animation to a still image? There are many apps for such purposes. Given below is a selection of the best apps you can use to animate images on both Android and iPhone devices with the help of animated photo collage apps.</p>
<h4 id="In-this-article-5"><a href="#In-this-article-5" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 [Top 10 Animated Photo Collage Apps ](#Part 1)</p>
<p>02 [Wondershare Filmora: The Advanced Editing App of 2022!](#Part 2)</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-Top-10-Animated-Photo-Collage-Apps"><a href="#Part-1-Top-10-Animated-Photo-Collage-Apps" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Top 10 Animated Photo Collage Apps"></a>Part 1 Top 10 Animated Photo Collage Apps</h2><p>We’ve compiled an index of the top 10 animated collage apps compatible with photo enthusiasts and photographers at every level of expertise. Most of these amazing apps are available for both iOS and Android, so there are numerous options no matter what device you’re using.</p>
<p>Before showcasing your collage-making skills, gather the perfect images from your last photography project.</p>
<h3 id="1-GIPHY"><a href="#1-GIPHY" class="headerlink" title="1. GIPHY"></a>1. GIPHY</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-photo-2.jpg"
                      alt="giphy"
                ></p>
<p>The GIPHY is the mega search engine for all things related to GIFs.</p>
<p>Here, you can easily upload and find reaction memes for anything under the sun; GIPHY is also available with a mobile app. It also helps you to frame your GIFs and animate photos. Then, you can upload them by using the inbuilt animation tools on the platform.</p>
<p>It consists of a sticker maker (available for iPhone X and later), and you can also add captions to your animated images or shoot your short videos.</p>
<h3 id="2-Motionleap"><a href="#2-Motionleap" class="headerlink" title="2. Motionleap"></a>2. Motionleap</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-photo-5.jpg"
                      alt="motionleap"
                ></p>
<p>Motionleap is also an ideal animated photo collage app, and for a good reason. This app is highly reviewed, with 250,000 plus ratings of five stars in the Play Store.</p>
<p>Motionleap is a free animated photo collage app, although there’s a subscription and Pro version, too. Also, it doesn’t put a watermark over your image when you download it to your phone.</p>
<p>The app’s primary goal is animating still images and converting them into short, concise, and looping videos. Programming directional cues can easily do it into your image by dragging your thumb across the screen.</p>
<p>You can also freeze certain image sections and apply filters on top of your picture to frame an atmosphere within your image.</p>
<p>Unluckily, Motionleap saves your animated still photos in video format unless you’ve paid for a Pro account.</p>
<h3 id="3-Movepic"><a href="#3-Movepic" class="headerlink" title="3. Movepic"></a>3. Movepic</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-photo-6.jpg"
                      alt="movepic"
                ></p>
<p>Movepic is almost similar to Motionleap in that it animates images, but you can make a massive chunk of this animation with its inbuilt filters and overlays.</p>
<p>The only limitation is that you wouldn’t be able to remove the watermark without updating it to a VIP account. Movepic also saves your pictures automatically as a movie file than within a GIFformat.</p>
<h3 id="4-ImgPlay"><a href="#4-ImgPlay" class="headerlink" title="4. ImgPlay"></a>4. ImgPlay</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-photo-3.jpg"
                      alt="imgplay"
                ></p>
<p>ImgPlay is another ideal animated collage maker app you can use to animate images. It creates ready-to-use animated images for the web and consists of easy-to-understand yet advanced controls. Unfortunately, it also adds a watermark on your image—one that you can’t remove unless you update to a complete account.</p>
<p>The process of making animated images online and GIFs can be in a couple of different ways within ImgPlay itself. You can use still photographs side-by-side, use burst images, or even videos.</p>
<h3 id="5-Zoetropic"><a href="#5-Zoetropic" class="headerlink" title="5. Zoetropic"></a>5. Zoetropic</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-photo-11.jpg"
                      alt="zoetropic"
                ></p>
<p>If you wish to animate your photo within a few minutes only, Zoetropic is for you. Though its functions aren’t as extensive as other apps we’ve mentioned, it does the job pretty well.</p>
<p>To get started, you choose your images and then select motion points. Next, you mask or stabilize the areas you want to keep still. Finally, you choose your overlays and animations. You can also change colors and add tags.</p>
<p>On the downside, it has limited the number of effects you can access on a free account. However, you might find what you’re considering if you are looking for a prompt manner to animate a photo online.</p>
<h3 id="6-StoryZ"><a href="#6-StoryZ" class="headerlink" title="6. StoryZ"></a>6. StoryZ</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-photo-8.jpg"
                      alt="storyz"
                ></p>
<p>Despite its unattractive user interface, StoryZ is one of the useful apps on this list. It works excellent with still photographs to animate them effectively via various programmed paths of movements, overlays, and color filters—a lot of which are free and unique. It also automatically saves your files as GIFs.</p>
<p>One of the most incredible things about StoryZ is cutting the watermark from your image if you preview a quick ad before saving the file.</p>
<h3 id="7-Lumyer"><a href="#7-Lumyer" class="headerlink" title="7. Lumyer"></a>7. Lumyer</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-photo-4.jpg"
                      alt="lumyer"
                ></p>
<p>Lumyer is one of the useful animated photo collage apps on our list, which lets you add hundreds and thousands of effects to your pictures to animate them. So whether you wish to include sparkle or subtle weather effects, seasonal animations for Christmas and Halloween, or all-out scene transformations like appearing on a rollercoaster, Lumyer can do it.</p>
<p>If you’re okay with the watermark, Lumyer is a good choice, but otherwise, you may prefer one of our other recommended photo animation college apps.</p>
<h3 id="8-VIMAGE-3D"><a href="#8-VIMAGE-3D" class="headerlink" title="8. VIMAGE 3D"></a>8. VIMAGE 3D</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-photo-9.jpg"
                      alt="vimage 3d"
                ></p>
<p>VIMAGE got recognized with Google Play award in 2018. It can make some pretty good-looking animated photos in just a few clicks. There’s a wide variety of animations, filters, and sounds to select among a bundle of options.</p>
<p>You don’t even need to select the object because VIMAGE detects and replaces it for you quite automatically.</p>
<p>Similar to these apps, you do need to pay to remove the watermark, get access to the full effects library, and you can export your photos online in up to 2560p resolution.</p>
<h3 id="9-Photo-Bender"><a href="#9-Photo-Bender" class="headerlink" title="9. Photo Bender"></a>9. Photo Bender</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-photo-7.jpg"
                      alt="photo bender"
                ></p>
<p>Photo Bender is an Android-specific animated photo collage app that helps you warp to animate photos digitally by coloring your image by stretching it, bending it, and using brushes. You can then export your transformed images as GIFs, JPEGs, MP4s, and PNGs.</p>
<p>While this app doesn’t contain ratings like others on this list, it is highly rated, so it’s still worth a look.</p>
<h3 id="10-Werble"><a href="#10-Werble" class="headerlink" title="10. Werble"></a>10. Werble</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-photo-10.jpg"
                      alt="werble"
                ></p>
<p>The primary purpose of Werble is to animate your images, and while the basic account is free, in-app purchases are also available. Most of Werble’s animations come through different filter effects that you can add on top of your images.</p>
<p>A downside to Werble is that it saves these images entirely automatically as GIFs, so they’re ready to use online. The limitation? However, you need to pay to cut the watermark that they place on your image. That watermark is huge enough to be disturbing.</p>

<p>Motionleap is also an ideal animated photo collage app, and for a good reason. This app is highly reviewed, with 250,000 plus ratings of five stars in the Play Store.</p>
<p>Motionleap is a free animated photo collage app, although there’s a subscription and Pro version, too. Also, it doesn’t put a watermark over your image when you download it to your phone.</p>
<p>The app’s primary goal is animating still images and converting them into short, concise, and looping videos. Programming directional cues can easily do it into your image by dragging your thumb across the screen.</p>
<p>You can also freeze certain image sections and apply filters on top of your picture to frame an atmosphere within your image.</p>
<p>Unluckily, Motionleap saves your animated still photos in video format unless you’ve paid for a Pro account.</p>

<p>Movepic is almost similar to Motionleap in that it animates images, but you can make a massive chunk of this animation with its inbuilt filters and overlays.</p>
<p>The only limitation is that you wouldn’t be able to remove the watermark without updating it to a VIP account. Movepic also saves your pictures automatically as a movie file than within a GIFformat.</p>

<p>The process of making animated images online and GIFs can be in a couple of different ways within ImgPlay itself. You can use still photographs side-by-side, use burst images, or even videos.</p>

<p>If you wish to animate your photo within a few minutes only, Zoetropic is for you. Though its functions aren’t as extensive as other apps we’ve mentioned, it does the job pretty well.</p>
<p>To get started, you choose your images and then select motion points. Next, you mask or stabilize the areas you want to keep still. Finally, you choose your overlays and animations. You can also change colors and add tags.</p>

<p>A downside to Werble is that it saves these images entirely automatically as GIFs, so they’re ready to use online. The limitation? However, you need to pay to cut the watermark that they place on your image. That watermark is huge enough to be disturbing.</p>

<p>What if you wish to animate images, adding movement to stationary objects in time? Well, there are apps for these purposes!</p>
<p>Videos and GIFs are a mainstay of social media. These days it’s rare to see a still photo online. The simplicity with which you can add filter and movement effects to your images has identified a proliferation of these online animated photos.</p>
<p>So what if you wish to apply animation to a still image? There are many apps for such purposes. Given below is a selection of the best apps you can use to animate images on both Android and iPhone devices with the help of animated photo collage apps.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-Top-10-Animated-Photo-Collage-Apps-3"><a href="#Part-1-Top-10-Animated-Photo-Collage-Apps-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Top 10 Animated Photo Collage Apps"></a>Part 1 Top 10 Animated Photo Collage Apps</h2><p>We’ve compiled an index of the top 10 animated collage apps compatible with photo enthusiasts and photographers at every level of expertise. Most of these amazing apps are available for both iOS and Android, so there are numerous options no matter what device you’re using.</p>
<p>Before showcasing your collage-making skills, gather the perfect images from your last photography project.</p>
<h3 id="1-GIPHY-3"><a href="#1-GIPHY-3" class="headerlink" title="1. GIPHY"></a>1. GIPHY</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-photo-2.jpg"
                      alt="giphy"
                ></p>
<p>The GIPHY is the mega search engine for all things related to GIFs.</p>
<p>Here, you can easily upload and find reaction memes for anything under the sun; GIPHY is also available with a mobile app. It also helps you to frame your GIFs and animate photos. Then, you can upload them by using the inbuilt animation tools on the platform.</p>
<p>It consists of a sticker maker (available for iPhone X and later), and you can also add captions to your animated images or shoot your short videos.</p>
<h3 id="2-Motionleap-3"><a href="#2-Motionleap-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Motionleap"></a>2. Motionleap</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-photo-5.jpg"
                      alt="motionleap"
                ></p>
<p>Motionleap is also an ideal animated photo collage app, and for a good reason. This app is highly reviewed, with 250,000 plus ratings of five stars in the Play Store.</p>
<p>Motionleap is a free animated photo collage app, although there’s a subscription and Pro version, too. Also, it doesn’t put a watermark over your image when you download it to your phone.</p>
<p>The app’s primary goal is animating still images and converting them into short, concise, and looping videos. Programming directional cues can easily do it into your image by dragging your thumb across the screen.</p>
<p>You can also freeze certain image sections and apply filters on top of your picture to frame an atmosphere within your image.</p>
<p>Unluckily, Motionleap saves your animated still photos in video format unless you’ve paid for a Pro account.</p>
<h3 id="3-Movepic-3"><a href="#3-Movepic-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Movepic"></a>3. Movepic</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-photo-6.jpg"
                      alt="movepic"
                ></p>
<p>Movepic is almost similar to Motionleap in that it animates images, but you can make a massive chunk of this animation with its inbuilt filters and overlays.</p>
<p>The only limitation is that you wouldn’t be able to remove the watermark without updating it to a VIP account. Movepic also saves your pictures automatically as a movie file than within a GIFformat.</p>
<h3 id="4-ImgPlay-3"><a href="#4-ImgPlay-3" class="headerlink" title="4. ImgPlay"></a>4. ImgPlay</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-photo-3.jpg"
                      alt="imgplay"
                ></p>
<p>ImgPlay is another ideal animated collage maker app you can use to animate images. It creates ready-to-use animated images for the web and consists of easy-to-understand yet advanced controls. Unfortunately, it also adds a watermark on your image—one that you can’t remove unless you update to a complete account.</p>
<p>The process of making animated images online and GIFs can be in a couple of different ways within ImgPlay itself. You can use still photographs side-by-side, use burst images, or even videos.</p>
<h3 id="5-Zoetropic-3"><a href="#5-Zoetropic-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Zoetropic"></a>5. Zoetropic</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-photo-11.jpg"
                      alt="zoetropic"
                ></p>
<p>If you wish to animate your photo within a few minutes only, Zoetropic is for you. Though its functions aren’t as extensive as other apps we’ve mentioned, it does the job pretty well.</p>
<p>To get started, you choose your images and then select motion points. Next, you mask or stabilize the areas you want to keep still. Finally, you choose your overlays and animations. You can also change colors and add tags.</p>
<p>On the downside, it has limited the number of effects you can access on a free account. However, you might find what you’re considering if you are looking for a prompt manner to animate a photo online.</p>
<h3 id="6-StoryZ-3"><a href="#6-StoryZ-3" class="headerlink" title="6. StoryZ"></a>6. StoryZ</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-photo-8.jpg"
                      alt="storyz"
                ></p>
<p>Despite its unattractive user interface, StoryZ is one of the useful apps on this list. It works excellent with still photographs to animate them effectively via various programmed paths of movements, overlays, and color filters—a lot of which are free and unique. It also automatically saves your files as GIFs.</p>
<p>One of the most incredible things about StoryZ is cutting the watermark from your image if you preview a quick ad before saving the file.</p>
<h3 id="7-Lumyer-3"><a href="#7-Lumyer-3" class="headerlink" title="7. Lumyer"></a>7. Lumyer</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload

                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-photo-4.jpg"
                      alt="lumyer"
                ></p>
<p>Lumyer is one of the useful animated photo collage apps on our list, which lets you add hundreds and thousands of effects to your pictures to animate them. So whether you wish to include sparkle or subtle weather effects, seasonal animations for Christmas and Halloween, or all-out scene transformations like appearing on a rollercoaster, Lumyer can do it.</p>
<p>If you’re okay with the watermark, Lumyer is a good choice, but otherwise, you may prefer one of our other recommended photo animation college apps.</p>

                      alt="vimage 3d"
                ></p>
<p>VIMAGE got recognized with Google Play award in 2018. It can make some pretty good-looking animated photos in just a few clicks. There’s a wide variety of animations, filters, and sounds to select among a bundle of options.</p>
<p>You don’t even need to select the object because VIMAGE detects and replaces it for you quite automatically.</p>
<p>Similar to these apps, you do need to pay to remove the watermark, get access to the full effects library, and you can export your photos online in up to 2560p resolution.</p>
<h3 id="9-Photo-Bender-3"><a href="#9-Photo-Bender-3" class="headerlink" title="9. Photo Bender"></a>9. Photo Bender</h3><p><img

<p>Blender is a FREE, open-source 3D Animation program that is very popular for beginner animators. It’s a good way of starting if you’re not yet sure about how far you want to go into animation as it won’t demand any immediate monetary commitment.</p>
<p>Now, as for its features, today, we’ll be focusing on <strong>Blender Rigging</strong> features.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-Why-Use-Blender-Rigging"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Use-Blender-Rigging" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Why Use Blender Rigging?"></a>Part 1 <strong>Why Use Blender Rigging?</strong></h2><p><strong>Blender Character Rigging</strong> is a great way of creating truly beautiful and realistic animations. Despite being an open-source program, it’s capable of doing just as much, if not more, than some of the more premium Animation software out there.</p>
<p>So, if you want to create video projects for your audience’s entertainment or edification with animation, then <strong>Blender Rigging</strong> is definitely something that you should consider. With this tool, you can create the complex animations that you need and then polish it up in a video editor like <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> (which is a premium, video-editing tool that you can use to perfect your finished <strong>Blender Rigging</strong> animations.)</p>

<p>These topics are each very long-winded on their own though, so we’ve linked appropriate video tutorials that you can learn more and reserved ourselves to a brief description of each technique so that you can determine whether it’s something that interests you (although, of course, our recommendation is that you check each one out so that you can get the full ‘Blender’ experience.)</p>
<h3 id="01Blender-Character-Rigging"><a href="#01Blender-Character-Rigging" class="headerlink" title="01Blender Character Rigging"></a>01<strong>Blender Character Rigging</strong></h3><p>The main thing people usually look at Blender for is, <strong>Blender Character Rigging</strong>. And, because it was created to emulate professional animation software, Blender has this function down to pat. To give you an idea of what features you can expect: Blender comes with custom bone shapes for easy <strong>Blender character rigging</strong>, it also comes with envelope skinny, skeleton skinning, and automatic skinning. With these alone, you can be assured that you will be able to create complex animations without much trouble.</p>
<h3 id="02Blender-Facial-Rigging"><a href="#02Blender-Facial-Rigging" class="headerlink" title="02Blender Facial Rigging"></a>02<strong>Blender Facial Rigging</strong></h3><p>Facial Rigging is usually a more complex subject that is avoided by animators without much experience. But, with Blender, facial rigging is possible. The YouTube video should show you the process of going about <strong>Blender Facial Rigging</strong> from start to finish (from sculpting the character face itself and then making use of <strong>Blender Rigging</strong> tools for setting up a skeletal structure for your face’s character to become animated.)</p>
<h3 id="03Blender-Muscle-Rigging"><a href="#03Blender-Muscle-Rigging" class="headerlink" title="03Blender Muscle Rigging"></a>03<strong>Blender Muscle Rigging</strong></h3><p>Creating a <strong>Blender Muscle Rig</strong> is exactly what it sounds like. It is, of course, much more complicated than normal rigging, but it is a good subject to familiarize yourself with anyway, as it will allow you to go to the ‘next stage’ as you say, with your Animations. The video that we’ve attached is from Pierrick Picaut, who has released a series of videos on the subject of <strong>Blender Rigging</strong> in general and has extensively explained how to create a <strong>Blender Human Rig</strong> from the general body, the face, the muscles, and so on.</p>
<h3 id="04Blender-Rigging"><a href="#04Blender-Rigging" class="headerlink" title="04Blender Rigging"></a>04<strong>Blender Rigging</strong></h3><p>Although a lot of Animation relies on more ‘traditional’ methods of expressing movement, one can still make use of more modern animation practices, like rigs, to set up their animations for movement. It’s an especially good skill to learn if you’re more interested in content-friendly animations (rather than creating a film of your own.)</p>
<h3 id="05Blender-Rigging"><a href="#05Blender-Rigging" class="headerlink" title="05Blender Rigging"></a>05<strong>Blender Rigging</strong></h3><p>This next tutorial is an introduction to basic <strong>Blender Rigging</strong>. It’s a good one to both start and end on, as it was created for beginners specifically, and uses an example that is perhaps easier to understand most. Make sure to give it a shot just in case.</p>

<p>Blender is a FREE, open-source 3D Animation program that is very popular for beginner animators. It’s a good way of starting if you’re not yet sure about how far you want to go into animation as it won’t demand any immediate monetary commitment.</p>
<p>Now, as for its features, today, we’ll be focusing on <strong>Blender Rigging</strong> features.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-Why-Use-Blender-Rigging-3"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Use-Blender-Rigging-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Why Use Blender Rigging?"></a>Part 1 <strong>Why Use Blender Rigging?</strong></h2><p><strong>Blender Character Rigging</strong> is a great way of creating truly beautiful and realistic animations. Despite being an open-source program, it’s capable of doing just as much, if not more, than some of the more premium Animation software out there.</p>
<p>So, if you want to create video projects for your audience’s entertainment or edification with animation, then <strong>Blender Rigging</strong> is definitely something that you should consider. With this tool, you can create the complex animations that you need and then polish it up in a video editor like <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> (which is a premium, video-editing tool that you can use to perfect your finished <strong>Blender Rigging</strong> animations.)</p>

<p>These topics are each very long-winded on their own though, so we’ve linked appropriate video tutorials that you can learn more and reserved ourselves to a brief description of each technique so that you can determine whether it’s something that interests you (although, of course, our recommendation is that you check each one out so that you can get the full ‘Blender’ experience.)</p>
<h3 id="01Blender-Character-Rigging-3"><a href="#01Blender-Character-Rigging-3" class="headerlink" title="01Blender Character Rigging"></a>01<strong>Blender Character Rigging</strong></h3><p>The main thing people usually look at Blender for is, <strong>Blender Character Rigging</strong>. And, because it was created to emulate professional animation software, Blender has this function down to pat. To give you an idea of what features you can expect: Blender comes with custom bone shapes for easy <strong>Blender character rigging</strong>, it also comes with envelope skinny, skeleton skinning, and automatic skinning. With these alone, you can be assured that you will be able to create complex animations without much trouble.</p>
<h3 id="02Blender-Facial-Rigging-3"><a href="#02Blender-Facial-Rigging-3" class="headerlink" title="02Blender Facial Rigging"></a>02<strong>Blender Facial Rigging</strong></h3><p>Facial Rigging is usually a more complex subject that is avoided by animators without much experience. But, with Blender, facial rigging is possible. The YouTube video should show you the process of going about <strong>Blender Facial Rigging</strong> from start to finish (from sculpting the character face itself and then making use of <strong>Blender Rigging</strong> tools for setting up a skeletal structure for your face’s character to become animated.)</p>
<h3 id="03Blender-Muscle-Rigging-3"><a href="#03Blender-Muscle-Rigging-3" class="headerlink" title="03Blender Muscle Rigging"></a>03<strong>Blender Muscle Rigging</strong></h3><p>Creating a <strong>Blender Muscle Rig</strong> is exactly what it sounds like. It is, of course, much more complicated than normal rigging, but it is a good subject to familiarize yourself with anyway, as it will allow you to go to the ‘next stage’ as you say, with your Animations. The video that we’ve attached is from Pierrick Picaut, who has released a series of videos on the subject of <strong>Blender Rigging</strong> in general and has extensively explained how to create a <strong>Blender Human Rig</strong> from the general body, the face, the muscles, and so on.</p>
<h3 id="04Blender-Rigging-3"><a href="#04Blender-Rigging-3" class="headerlink" title="04Blender Rigging"></a>04<strong>Blender Rigging</strong></h3><p>Although a lot of Animation relies on more ‘traditional’ methods of expressing movement, one can still make use of more modern animation practices, like rigs, to set up their animations for movement. It’s an especially good skill to learn if you’re more interested in content-friendly animations (rather than creating a film of your own.)</p>
<h3 id="05Blender-Rigging-3"><a href="#05Blender-Rigging-3" class="headerlink" title="05Blender Rigging"></a>05<strong>Blender Rigging</strong></h3><p>This next tutorial is an introduction to basic <strong>Blender Rigging</strong>. It’s a good one to both start and end on, as it was created for beginners specifically, and uses an example that is perhaps easier to understand most. Make sure to give it a shot just in case.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-Introduction-to-Rigging-in-Blender-Course-3"><a href="#Part-3-Introduction-to-Rigging-in-Blender-Course-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 Introduction to Rigging in Blender Course"></a>Part 3 <strong>Introduction to Rigging in Blender Course</strong></h2><p>For this next part, we introduce two other resources that you can take advantage of to learn more about <strong>Blender Rigging</strong>. Whether it be about <strong>Blender character rigging</strong>, <strong>Blender facial rigging</strong>, <strong>free blender rigs, creating muscle rigs</strong>, and so and so forth. These resources have got your back.</p>
<h3 id="01Where-to-Learn-the-Course-3"><a href="#01Where-to-Learn-the-Course-3" class="headerlink" title="01Where to Learn the Course?"></a>01<strong>Where to Learn the Course?</strong></h3><p>The first major course that we think you might be interested in is Mark Masters’ <strong>blender rigging</strong> course. You can find this course at PluralSight (which is a website that is focused on helping users of software develop their skills). Mark Masters, the instructor for this course, is a professional animator and works as a Animator for the animation studio, Steelhouse Productions. So, you can be sure that there is much that you can learn from him.</p>

<p>Batman is one of the most popular and long-lasting characters in DC animated movies. There can always be an argument on Marvel and DC movies. Although, DC remains the king regards to animated movies. DC animated movies are better coordinated with live-action scenes. Each story features different aspects of Gotham city and its issues.</p>
<p>Batman or “Bruce Wayne” is an orphan billionaire living a carefree life. Yet, he leads the gods and exceptional ones like they do not matter much. The technology and the will Batman demonstrates are peculiar. No wonder Batman animated movies are one of the bestselling of all time. I could even say, in the early 90s, Batman was the most favorite hero of DC animated movies.</p>
