<p>3D animation is a graphic design technique that uses motions to bring props, characters, objects, etc., to life. For a long time, 3D animation has created TV shows, films, and games, but now it is widely used to create materials for businesses that help them advertise their services and products. The most common usage of 3D animation is creating three-dimensional moving objects and placing them in a digital environment. There is software used to generate these objects specifically for 3D animation with <strong>3D animation courses online for free</strong> to learn how to use such software. This software helps 3D animators to create the illusion of movement needed to bring these objects to life.</p>
<p>As the popularity of 3D animation begins to grow, its usage also increases. 3D animation can be useful for the following:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Many businesses use 3D animation for presentation and more examples and graphics.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> 3D animation is used in real estate as many apartment complexes use it to create interior and exterior renders for their properties. 3D animation allows renters or buyers to view the property without visiting it.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> 3D animation can also be valuable in the medical industry to create exciting graphics for presentation.</p>
<p>You can divide the process of 3D animation into three primary phases:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Modeling:</strong> The modeling stage is how characters or objects get created. This stage can include scanning natural objects into a computer or using a modeling tool. Both methods are helpful and outstanding. When you scan real-world objects into your computer, it saves a lot of time; creating a model entirely by yourself using a tool will give you control over the entire look. Irrespective of the methods used, textures must be added to the character or objects before moving to the next stage.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Animation and layout:</strong> At this stage, the created models are animated and positioned into a particular scene, first determining a layout by creating a set and adding objects into it. The characters and things must be animated by assigning animation variables, and then models within the scene can be given life through motion capture and keyframing.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Rendering</strong>: This stage is where the scene generates into the finished image by using a specific software as the process of rendering cannot be handled by a typical computer</p>
<p>For <strong>learning 3D animation</strong>, practice, to make yourself perfect for getting your 3D animation as smooth and precise as you would like it to take some time. If your set goal is to create 3D characters, you first need to know how to recreate people in a digital form.

<p>3D animation is a graphic design technique that uses motions to bring props, characters, objects, etc., to life. For a long time, 3D animation has created TV shows, films, and games, but now it is widely used to create materials for businesses that help them advertise their services and products. The most common usage of 3D animation is creating three-dimensional moving objects and placing them in a digital environment. There is software used to generate these objects specifically for 3D animation with <strong>3D animation courses online for free</strong> to learn how to use such software. This software helps 3D animators to create the illusion of movement needed to bring these objects to life.</p>
<p>As the popularity of 3D animation begins to grow, its usage also increases. 3D animation can be useful for the following:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Many businesses use 3D animation for presentation and more examples and graphics.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> 3D animation is used in real estate as many apartment complexes use it to create interior and exterior renders for their properties. 3D animation allows renters or buyers to view the property without visiting it.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> 3D animation can also be valuable in the medical industry to create exciting graphics for presentation.</p>
<p>You can divide the process of 3D animation into three primary phases:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Modeling:</strong> The modeling stage is how characters or objects get created. This stage can include scanning natural objects into a computer or using a modeling tool. Both methods are helpful and outstanding. When you scan real-world objects into your computer, it saves a lot of time; creating a model entirely by yourself using a tool will give you control over the entire look. Irrespective of the methods used, textures must be added to the character or objects before moving to the next stage.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Animation and layout:</strong> At this stage, the created models are animated and positioned into a particular scene, first determining a layout by creating a set and adding objects into it. The characters and things must be animated by assigning animation variables, and then models within the scene can be given life through motion capture and keyframing.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Rendering</strong>: This stage is where the scene generates into the finished image by using a specific software as the process of rendering cannot be handled by a typical computer</p>
<p>For <strong>learning 3D animation</strong>, practice, to make yourself perfect for getting your 3D animation as smooth and precise as you would like it to take some time. If your set goal is to create 3D characters, you first need to know how to recreate people in a digital form. According to the 3D animation forum, it takes at least eight months to learn how to animate if only you spend about three to four hours every day. It takes firm dedication to <strong>learn 3D animation and graphic design courses</strong>.</p>

<p>3D animation is a graphic design technique that uses motions to bring props, characters, objects, etc., to life. For a long time, 3D animation has created TV shows, films, and games, but now it is widely used to create materials for businesses that help them advertise their services and products. The most common usage of 3D animation is creating three-dimensional moving objects and placing them in a digital environment. There is software used to generate these objects specifically for 3D animation with <strong>3D animation courses online for free</strong> to learn how to use such software. This software helps 3D animators to create the illusion of movement needed to bring these objects to life.</p>
<p>As the popularity of 3D animation begins to grow, its usage also increases. 3D animation can be useful for the following:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Many businesses use 3D animation for presentation and more examples and graphics.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> 3D animation is used in real estate as many apartment complexes use it to create interior and exterior renders for their properties. 3D animation allows renters or buyers to view the property without visiting it.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> 3D animation can also be valuable in the medical industry to create exciting graphics for presentation.</p>
<p>You can divide the process of 3D animation into three primary phases:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Modeling:</strong> The modeling stage is how characters or objects get created. This stage can include scanning natural objects into a computer or using a modeling tool. Both methods are helpful and outstanding. When you scan real-world objects into your computer, it saves a lot of time; creating a model entirely by yourself using a tool will give you control over the entire look. Irrespective of the methods used, textures must be added to the character or objects before moving to the next stage.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Animation and layout:</strong> At this stage, the created models are animated and positioned into a particular scene, first determining a layout by creating a set and adding objects into it. The characters and things must be animated by assigning animation variables, and then models within the scene can be given life through motion capture and keyframing.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Rendering</strong>: This stage is where the scene generates into the finished image by using a specific software as the process of rendering cannot be handled by a typical computer</p>
<p>For <strong>learning 3D animation</strong>, practice, to make yourself perfect for getting your 3D animation as smooth and precise as you would like it to take some time. If your set goal is to create 3D characters, you first need to know how to recreate people in a digital form. According to the 3D animation forum, it takes at least eight months to learn how to animate if only you spend about three to four hours every day. It takes firm dedication to <strong>learn 3D animation and graphic design courses</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 1</strong>: creating the story and conceptualizing</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 2</strong>: making the 3D models</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 3</strong>: rigging, texturing, and animation</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 4</strong>: setting up the cameras and lightning</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 5</strong>: rendering</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 6</strong>: applying special effects and compositing</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 7</strong>: editing, music, and Foley</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 8</strong>: the final output</p>

<p>3D animation is a graphic design technique that uses motions to bring props, characters, objects, etc., to life. For a long time, 3D animation has created TV shows, films, and games, but now it is widely used to create materials for businesses that help them advertise their services and products. The most common usage of 3D animation is creating three-dimensional moving objects and placing them in a digital environment. There is software used to generate these objects specifically for 3D animation with <strong>3D animation courses online for free</strong> to learn how to use such software. This software helps 3D animators to create the illusion of movement needed to bring these objects to life.</p>
<p>As the popularity of 3D animation begins to grow, its usage also increases. 3D animation can be useful for the following:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Many businesses use 3D animation for presentation and more examples and graphics.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> 3D animation is used in real estate as many apartment complexes use it to create interior and exterior renders for their properties. 3D animation allows renters or buyers to view the property without visiting it.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> 3D animation can also be valuable in the medical industry to create exciting graphics for presentation.</p>
<p>You can divide the process of 3D animation into three primary phases:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Modeling:</strong> The modeling stage is how characters or objects get created. This stage can include scanning natural objects into a computer or using a modeling tool. Both methods are helpful and outstanding. When you scan real-world objects into your computer, it saves a lot of time; creating a model entirely by yourself using a tool will give you control over the entire look. Irrespective of the methods used, textures must be added to the character or objects before moving to the next stage.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Animation and layout:</strong> At this stage, the created models are animated and positioned into a particular scene, first determining a layout by creating a set and adding objects into it. The characters and things must be animated by assigning animation variables, and then models within the scene can be given life through motion capture and keyframing.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Rendering</strong>: This stage is where the scene generates into the finished image by using a specific software as the process of rendering cannot be handled by a typical computer</p>
<p>For <strong>learning 3D animation</strong>, practice, to make yourself perfect for getting your 3D animation as smooth and precise as you would like it to take some time. If your set goal is to create 3D characters, you first need to know how to recreate people in a digital form. According to the 3D animation forum, it takes at least eight months to learn how to animate if only you spend about three to four hours every day. It takes firm dedication to <strong>learn 3D animation and graphic design courses</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 1</strong>: creating the story and conceptualizing</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 2</strong>: making the 3D models</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 3</strong>: rigging, texturing, and animation</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 4</strong>: setting up the cameras and lightning</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 5</strong>: rendering</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 6</strong>: applying special effects and compositing</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 7</strong>: editing, music, and Foley</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 8</strong>: the final output</p>

<p>Do you land among those social media freaks how want to share just every moment of your day with your peers, or are you confused on selecting the best photos and videos of a cherished event, vacation or bringing home a new utility and end up posting a heap of media on your social media handles?</p>
<p>If your answer is a guilty ‘Yes’, you can try on giving up the habit now by creating an <strong>Instagram story photo slideshow</strong> to share mini album of your most loved images from the event or vacation. You can use the feature to create a collection of amazing videos as well and share it too with your friends on social media without the guilt of becoming a feed-hog.</p>
<p>Want a practical experience of using Instagram slideshows? See through the following tutorial to understand the exact creation process:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Choose the First Image</strong></p>
<p>Begin with selecting the first image for your slideshow, just as you would ideally do for a normal, single image Instagram feed and long press the same.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Confirming the Selection</strong></p>
<p>Navigate to the bottom right corner of your selected image to locate a button similar to a photo slideshow. Tap the button to see a ‘1’ inscribed in a blue circle appear on your chosen image.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Make Further Selections</strong></p>
<p>You can now proceed to select other images or videos for the slideshow, in a similar fashion as the first one. You are allowed to include a maximum of 10 media files within the slideshow.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Customize Your Creation</strong></p>
<p>Tap the ‘Next’ button when you have finished making the required selections. The editor interface will now open to let you customize the selected images with a series of effects and filters, both one at a time, as well as the entire set altogether. You can also work with modifying the order of appearance of the photos and videos if required.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: The Final Touches</strong></p>
<p>Once you are done with the editing process, continue to follow the remaining steps, as you would do to create a normal Instagram post. You can include captions, locations and tag your peers on the platform.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6: Time to Share!</strong></p>
<p>Your Instagram slideshow is ready to be posted. Upload it either to your feed or story to receive a hoard of likes and comments!</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Animated Text Overlays</strong></p>
<p>If your Instagram story slideshows are missing out on the visual spunk, try complimenting their images and videos with animated transitions and text overlays. Short and quick animations are the best ways to enhance a slideshow story with an eye catching effect. Applying a variety of text overlays would help to keep the audience curious about the next visual delight.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Prefer a Vertical Aspect Ratio</strong></p>
<p>While the landscape mode tends to ward off certain portions of the visual media from a slideshow being played across multiple sized screens, using the portrait mode with a vertical aspect ratio suits best to almost every screen size. Taking care of this fact will ensure that your audience does not get distracted with the semi visible contents of the slideshow story.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Choose Your Editing Effects Wisely</strong></p>
<p>Regardless of the slideshow creation tool you prefer, there are a diversity of effects, templates, design elements and filters to uplift your craft with the perfect look. However, you should be cautious enough while making your choice so that the balance of colors, fonts and themes is affordably maintained, lest you would end up with a messy and loud Instagram story slideshow, that would not gather much appeal.</p>

However, you can interact with other members of the community to create multiple avatars if you wish. Or, you can share your <strong>caricature pictures</strong> on social media.</p>

<h3 id="02Color-Cartoon-Caricature-Maker"><a href="#02Color-Cartoon-Caricature-Maker" class="headerlink" title="02Color Cartoon Caricature Maker"></a>02<strong>Color Cartoon Caricature Maker</strong></h3><p>This next <strong>caricature maker</strong> app uses a more realistic style akin to what is usually used for a <strong>political caricature</strong> of famous individuals and politicians. It’s called ‘Color Cartoon Caricature Maker’ and, while not as extensive in its features as the previous app, it can be used to turn an image completely into a caricature (which means that it can be used for photographs with more than one person or focus.)</p>

<p>Much like the second app, while it’s more suitable for enhancing the features of one person, it does work for group pictures as well.</p>

<h3 id="04Photic-Cartoon-Yourself-AI"><a href="#04Photic-Cartoon-Yourself-AI" class="headerlink" title="04Photic - Cartoon Yourself AI"></a>04<strong>Photic - Cartoon Yourself AI</strong></h3><p>This next app, called ‘Photic’ is much like our previously listed app, PicMagic. As you can see from the image provided, it can <strong>make a caricature of a photo</strong> but in a subtle way that is undeniably more of a ‘cartoony’ style than what you might be looking for. Keep that in mind.</p>
<p>The best part of it is that you can use it along with iMessage — making it very easy to share your finished <strong>caricature pictures</strong> with friends and family. The downside? It is best used for solo picture caricature-like only.</p>

As you can see from the image provided, the style of caricature is a lot more realistic here. Very similar to what you normally see of western comics (which only subtly changes the features of a person to look more rendered.) The best part of this app? Well, unlike some of the other options on this list, it works great for group pictures.</p>

It’s called ‘Voilà AI Artist Cartoon Photo’ and the main difference between it and the ToonApp app that we introduced earlier is that it uses a different caricature style. Not unlike what you see from 3D animations — which is a mix of realism and cartoony.</p>
<p>This tool, much like a lot of other alternatives, is best used for selfies.</p>

<p>It works for group photographs surprisingly well as well. With the AI recognizing and applying the ‘morph’ effect to everyone.</p>

<h3 id="08Face-Caricature"><a href="#08Face-Caricature" class="headerlink" title="08Face Caricature"></a>08<strong>Face Caricature</strong></h3><p>The next <strong>caricature maker</strong> on our list is the app called ‘Face Caricature.’ The best part of this app, undoubtedly, is the fact that it offers several ‘caricature’ styles that you can choose from. So, you aren’t stuck with just one cartoon style. It’s better for selfies, however — it doesn’t work as well as a group picture <strong>caricature maker</strong>.</p>

There are several caricature art styles for you to choose from, which are always fun. Plus, it offers easy save-and-share features. As a final note, this app works best as a selfie app.</p>

It’s just a matter of finding the right distortive effect to mimic the look of an actual <strong>caricature sketch</strong>. The best part about it is that it’s basically a custom <strong>caricature maker</strong> — one that allows you to control exactly what features are exaggerated.</p>

Here, we introduce a quick and easy way to draw caricatures. Take it more as an overview of what exactly caricatures are and how you can create them by following a specific set of steps. Ah, but of course, just to make sure that you are getting something out of it, we’ve also included a recommendation for a tool that you can use in order to step up your caricature creation.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Get a Reference Photo.</strong></p>
<p>Any good caricature starts with a good reference photo. If you’re not familiar with the term, a reference photo is basically any photograph that you use in order to draw inspiration from.</p>
<p>When making a caricature, that usually means finding a portrait (like the one below) that you can directly refer to when making your <strong>caricature sketch</strong>.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects11.png"
                      alt="Find a Portrait for Reference"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Exaggerate Features.</strong></p>
<p>What is the point of caricatures? Well, it all comes down to the exaggeration of features. Whether that’s enlarging the person’s head to be half the size of a person or distorting the features of their face to make one more prominent than another. There’s an endless number of ways you can go about doing it.</p>
<p>Just remember, when making a caricature sketch, there are no such things as rules. While you do have a reference photo in front of you, you don’t have to draw it exactly as you see it. Make the eyes farther apart, exaggerate the lift of the eyebrows, give them a teeny tiny nose, etc., etc..</p>
<p>Just let your imagination run wild.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Exaggerate the Features of Your Reference"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Find a Reliable Tool.</strong></p>
<p>And, finally, if you really want to take your caricatures to the next level, consider animating them. That is the main point of caricatures, after all.</p>
<p>And, if you’re going to go about doing such a thing, make sure that you have a reliable tool on your side. For example, having something like <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>, a video editor that has an endless amount of presets and effects that you can choose from, may prove to be exactly what you need to get to the next stage of your caricature creation.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> There’s a lot of these caricature makers for you to choose from as well. Proven by the fact that we were able to easily find at least ten — all of which you can use (some in different ways) to transform your photographs into caricature works.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Of course, if you want to take the traditional route and draw caricatures yourself, that’s possible too. Just remember the three tips that we outlined above: get a reference, exaggerate, and use good tools.</p>

As you can see from the image provided, it can <strong>make a caricature of a photo</strong> but in a subtle way that is undeniably more of a ‘cartoony’ style than what you might be looking for. Keep that in mind.</p>
<p>The best part of it is that you can use it along with iMessage — making it very easy to share your finished <strong>caricature pictures</strong> with friends and family. The downside? It is best used for solo picture caricature-like only.</p>

As you can see from the image provided, the style of caricature is a lot more realistic here. Very similar to what you normally see of western comics (which only subtly changes the features of a person to look more rendered.) The best part of this app? Well, unlike some of the other options on this list, it works great for group pictures.</p>

It’s called ‘Voilà AI Artist Cartoon Photo’ and the main difference between it and the ToonApp app that we introduced earlier is that it uses a different caricature style. Not unlike what you see from 3D animations — which is a mix of realism and cartoony.</p>
<p>This tool, much like a lot of other alternatives, is best used for selfies.</p>

<p>It works for group photographs surprisingly well as well. With the AI recognizing and applying the ‘morph’ effect to everyone.</p>

So, you aren’t stuck with just one cartoon style. It’s better for selfies, however — it doesn’t work as well as a group picture <strong>caricature maker</strong>.</p>

Here, we introduce a quick and easy way to draw caricatures. Take it more as an overview of what exactly caricatures are and how you can create them by following a specific set of steps. Ah, but of course, just to make sure that you are getting something out of it, we’ve also included a recommendation for a tool that you can use in order to step up your caricature creation.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Get a Reference Photo.</strong></p>
<p>Any good caricature starts with a good reference photo. If you’re not familiar with the term, a reference photo is basically any photograph that you use in order to draw inspiration from.</p>
<p>When making a caricature, that usually means finding a portrait (like the one below) that you can directly refer to when making your <strong>caricature sketch</strong>.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects11.png"
                      alt="Find a Portrait for Reference"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Exaggerate Features.</strong></p>
<p>What is the point of caricatures? Well, it all comes down to the exaggeration of features. Whether that’s enlarging the person’s head to be half the size of a person or distorting the features of their face to make one more prominent than another. There’s an endless number of ways you can go about doing it.</p>
<p>Just remember, when making a caricature sketch, there are no such things as rules. While you do have a reference photo in front of you, you don’t have to draw it exactly as you see it. Make the eyes farther apart, exaggerate the lift of the eyebrows, give them a teeny tiny nose, etc., etc..</p>
<p>Just let your imagination run wild.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects12.png"
                      alt="Exaggerate the Features of Your Reference"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Find a Reliable Tool.</strong></p>
<p>And, finally, if you really want to take your caricatures to the next level, consider animating them. That is the main point of caricatures, after all.</p>
<p>And, if you’re going to go about doing such a thing, make sure that you have a reliable tool on your side. For example, having something like <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>, a video editor that has an endless amount of presets and effects that you can choose from, may prove to be exactly what you need to get to the next stage of your caricature creation.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> There’s a lot of these caricature makers for you to choose from as well. Proven by the fact that we were able to easily find at least ten — all of which you can use (some in different ways) to transform your photographs into caricature works.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Of course, if you want to take the traditional route and draw caricatures yourself, that’s possible too. Just remember the three tips that we outlined above: get a reference, exaggerate, and use good tools.</p>

<p>We certainly have a couple of recommendations to offer to you. There’s a surprisingly large amount of both <strong>caricature photo maker</strong> apps and <strong>online caricature maker</strong> tools.</p>
<p>Today, we’ll be focusing on the apps, to keep things easily accessible. And, in the end, we’ve even included a quick step-by-step guide on how to <strong>make a caricature of a photo</strong>.</p>

MomentCam Cartoons &amp; Stickers</strong></h3><p>The first of the <strong>caricature maker</strong> apps on our list is ‘MomentCam Cartoon &amp; Stickers’ — this app is part of another tool called ‘Avatar Maker Bundle’, but it can be used on its own to create caricature versions of yourself that you can use to express emotions (an avatar, if you will).</p>
<p>This app was made primarily to help the user to create an avatar that matches their look (with accessorization features to complete the set). However, you can interact with other members of the community to create multiple avatars if you wish. Or, you can share your <strong>caricature pictures</strong> on social media.</p>

It’s called ‘Color Cartoon Caricature Maker’ and, while not as extensive in its features as the previous app, it can be used to turn an image completely into a caricature (which means that it can be used for photographs with more than one person or focus.)</p>

<p>Much like the second app, while it’s more suitable for enhancing the features of one person, it does work for group pictures as well.</p>

As you can see from the image provided, it can <strong>make a caricature of a photo</strong> but in a subtle way that is undeniably more of a ‘cartoony’ style than what you might be looking for. Keep that in mind.</p>
<p>The best part of it is that you can use it along with iMessage — making it very easy to share your finished <strong>caricature pictures</strong> with friends and family. The downside? It is best used for solo picture caricature-like only.</p>

It’s called ‘Voilà AI Artist Cartoon Photo’ and the main difference between it and the ToonApp app that we introduced earlier is that it uses a different caricature style. Not unlike what you see from 3D animations — which is a mix of realism and cartoony.</p>
<p>This tool, much like a lot of other alternatives, is best used for selfies.</p>

<p>It works for group photographs surprisingly well as well. With the AI recognizing and applying the ‘morph’ effect to everyone.</p>

Here, we introduce a quick and easy way to draw caricatures. Take it more as an overview of what exactly caricatures are and how you can create them by following a specific set of steps. Ah, but of course, just to make sure that you are getting something out of it, we’ve also included a recommendation for a tool that you can use in order to step up your caricature creation.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Get a Reference Photo.</strong></p>
<p>Any good caricature starts with a good reference photo. If you’re not familiar with the term, a reference photo is basically any photograph that you use in order to draw inspiration from.</p>
<p>When making a caricature, that usually means finding a portrait (like the one below) that you can directly refer to when making your <strong>caricature sketch</strong>.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects11.png"
                      alt="Find a Portrait for Reference"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Exaggerate Features.</strong></p>
<p>What is the point of caricatures? Well, it all comes down to the exaggeration of features. Whether that’s enlarging the person’s head to be half the size of a person or distorting the features of their face to make one more prominent than another. There’s an endless number of ways you can go about doing it.</p>
<p>Just remember, when making a caricature sketch, there are no such things as rules. While you do have a reference photo in front of you, you don’t have to draw it exactly as you see it. Make the eyes farther apart, exaggerate the lift of the eyebrows, give them a teeny tiny nose, etc., etc..</p>
<p>Just let your imagination run wild.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects12.png"
                      alt="Exaggerate the Features of Your Reference"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Find a Reliable Tool.</strong></p>
<p>And, finally, if you really want to take your caricatures to the next level, consider animating them. That is the main point of caricatures, after all.</p>
<p>And, if you’re going to go about doing such a thing, make sure that you have a reliable tool on your side. For example, having something like <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>, a video editor that has an endless amount of presets and effects that you can choose from, may prove to be exactly what you need to get to the next stage of your caricature creation.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> There’s a lot of these caricature makers for you to choose from as well. Proven by the fact that we were able to easily find at least ten — all of which you can use (some in different ways) to transform your photographs into caricature works.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Of course, if you want to take the traditional route and draw caricatures yourself, that’s possible too. Just remember the three tips that we outlined above: get a reference, exaggerate, and use good tools.</p>

<p>We certainly have a couple of recommendations to offer to you. There’s a surprisingly large amount of both <strong>caricature photo maker</strong> apps and <strong>online caricature maker</strong> tools.</p>
<p>Today, we’ll be focusing on the apps, to keep things easily accessible. And, in the end, we’ve even included a quick step-by-step guide on how to <strong>make a caricature of a photo</strong>.</p>

MomentCam Cartoons &amp; Stickers</strong></h3><p>The first of the <strong>caricature maker</strong> apps on our list is ‘MomentCam Cartoon &amp; Stickers’ — this app is part of another tool called ‘Avatar Maker Bundle’, but it can be used on its own to create caricature versions of yourself that you can use to express emotions (an avatar, if you will).</p>
<p>This app was made primarily to help the user to create an avatar that matches their look (with accessorization features to complete the set). However, you can interact with other members of the community to create multiple avatars if you wish. Or, you can share your <strong>caricature pictures</strong> on social media.</p>

It’s called ‘Color Cartoon Caricature Maker’ and, while not as extensive in its features as the previous app, it can be used to turn an image completely into a caricature (which means that it can be used for photographs with more than one person or focus.)</p>

<p>Much like the second app, while it’s more suitable for enhancing the features of one person, it does work for group pictures as well.</p>

As you can see from the image provided, it can <strong>make a caricature of a photo</strong> but in a subtle way that is undeniably more of a ‘cartoony’ style than what you might be looking for. Keep that in mind.</p>
<p>The best part of it is that you can use it along with iMessage — making it very easy to share your finished <strong>caricature pictures</strong> with friends and family. The downside? It is best used for solo picture caricature-like only.</p>

As you can see from the image provided, the style of caricature is a lot more realistic here. Very similar to what you normally see of western comics (which only subtly changes the features of a person to look more rendered.) The best part of this app? Well, unlike some of the other options on this list, it works great for group pictures.</p>

So, you aren’t stuck with just one cartoon style. It’s better for selfies, however — it doesn’t work as well as a group picture <strong>caricature maker</strong>.</p>

Here, we introduce a quick and easy way to draw caricatures. Take it more as an overview of what exactly caricatures are and how you can create them by following a specific set of steps. Ah, but of course, just to make sure that you are getting something out of it, we’ve also included a recommendation for a tool that you can use in order to step up your caricature creation.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Get a Reference Photo.</strong></p>
<p>Any good caricature starts with a good reference photo. If you’re not familiar with the term, a reference photo is basically any photograph that you use in order to draw inspiration from.</p>
<p>When making a caricature, that usually means finding a portrait (like the one below) that you can directly refer to when making your <strong>caricature sketch</strong>.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects11.png"
                      alt="Find a Portrait for Reference"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Exaggerate Features.</strong></p>
<p>What is the point of caricatures? Well, it all comes down to the exaggeration of features. Whether that’s enlarging the person’s head to be half the size of a person or distorting the features of their face to make one more prominent than another. There’s an endless number of ways you can go about doing it.</p>
<p>Just remember, when making a caricature sketch, there are no such things as rules. While you do have a reference photo in front of you, you don’t have to draw it exactly as you see it. Make the eyes farther apart, exaggerate the lift of the eyebrows, give them a teeny tiny nose, etc., etc..</p>
<p>Just let your imagination run wild.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects12.png"
                      alt="Exaggerate the Features of Your Reference"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Find a Reliable Tool.</strong></p>
<p>And, finally, if you really want to take your caricatures to the next level, consider animating them. That is the main point of caricatures, after all.</p>
<p>And, if you’re going to go about doing such a thing, make sure that you have a reliable tool on your side. For example, having something like <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>, a video editor that has an endless amount of presets and effects that you can choose from, may prove to be exactly what you need to get to the next stage of your caricature creation.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> There’s a lot of these caricature makers for you to choose from as well. Proven by the fact that we were able to easily find at least ten — all of which you can use (some in different ways) to transform your photographs into caricature works.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Of course, if you want to take the traditional route and draw caricatures yourself, that’s possible too. Just remember the three tips that we outlined above: get a reference, exaggerate, and use good tools.</p>
