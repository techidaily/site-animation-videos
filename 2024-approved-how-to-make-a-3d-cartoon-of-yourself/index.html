<p>The Voila AI artist app can be downloaded from the Apple App store and Android Play Store. You can use the app for free but for faster editing and an ad free experience, you will need to upgrade to the paid version. Other than just creating a cartoon of yourself, you can also create renaissance portraits and caricatures.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Step 1: Download the Voila AI artist App for your device, and complete the installation process. Allow the app to access your Phone’s Camera rolling permission.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Step 2: Select the style option you want to use. What we are using here is 3D cartoon (other options: 2D Cartoon, Caricature &amp; and the rest). Touch the arrow and start.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Step 3: Now, with your camera roll open, click a new one or choose from your gallery. You can also find a <strong>celebrities</strong> option where you can search for celebrities. This generates a four-grid choice. If you are using the free version, then be prepared to encounter one or two ads. After a few seconds, you can exit out and get back to your images.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Step 4: You will receive a composite grid of four options; your original image, plus three cartoon representations (Royalty 3D, Baby 3D &amp; Cartoon 3D). Here, you can select the option you like the most and start editing. Locate the up arrow button to immediately share on your preferred social media or simply save a copy in your device.</p>

This has now started the rush to create a live virtual interaction space, and big companies like Microsoft and Nvidia are now competing with each other to bridge the gap.</p>
<p>Soon, activities like convening meetings, attending live events or even dating online would take place in virtual environments. So best be prepared for the future by creating a 3D avatar for yourself.</p>
<p>Your virtual avatar would be able to interact with the real world through a virtual platform by using VR headsets and other tech. Sensing your virtual presence would be almost the same as the real world for your peers and colleagues. You can attend a meeting without ever having to travel.</p>
<p>The process behind creating a <strong>3D cartoon of yourself</strong> for Meta platforms starts by establishing a facial rig which is like a framework for the cartoon animations to sit on. These days, most apps come with automatic FACS facial rigging which is why certain Instagram filters like the Puppy nose filter was possible.</p>
<p>Presently, creating a complete 3D virtual model of yourself is a bit complicated to do on your own but soon this service will be automated in an app for you.</p>

<p>Note; These steps are to be perceived as a simplified overview of your objectives when editing on Photoshop;</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> To start out on turning your image into a 3D character, you need to learn how to create layers and then stack them on each other.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can then ‘liquify’ these layers to form a mould for your image.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Apply skin softening techniques to take away the realistic features of the photo before working on turning it into a cartoon.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Now you can start focus on applying the details to features like eyes, hair, nose and facial lines on your cartoon image.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can also change the colour of any individual features on your image. This method is applicable in making caricatures of your photo as well.</p>

<p>But, if you are someone who wants to get into animation, but don’t have an expensive budget, claymations can be a great tool to share your story with the world and attract a global audience. In this guide, we are going to talk about claymations, some of the most popular claymation websites, and the best ways to get started with <strong>stop motion claymation</strong>.

By the end of this guide, you’ll be running out to buy clay and make some high-quality <strong>clay stop-motion animations</strong>.</p>

<p>03 [Best 5 Clay for Stop Motion and Ways to Get Started](#Part 3)</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-Ways-to-Make-Stop-Motion-Videos-with-Clay-Using-Your-Phone"><a href="#Part-1-Ways-to-Make-Stop-Motion-Videos-with-Clay-Using-Your-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Ways to Make Stop Motion Videos with Clay Using Your Phone"></a>Part 1 Ways to Make Stop Motion Videos with Clay Using Your Phone</h2><p>So, now that you are familiar with the basic concept of <strong>clay stop animation</strong>, let’s understand how you can get started with claymation animations. Ideally, if you are an absolute beginner, you would want to start by understanding the dynamics of creating clay models first. Whether you are going to create a animation or a simple stop motion clip, the models will play a major role in the story and it would be important that these models look appealing.</p>
<p>When it comes to capturing the motion, you don’t need any expensive cameras. You can easily shoot the entire motion on your phone as well. Today, even the basic smartphones come with recording features and they are enough to capture the movement of your clay models. However, if you want to keep the production quality as high as possible, make sure to invest in a decent tripod. A tripod will ensure that your <strong>stop motion claymation</strong> doesn’t feel jerky at all.</p>
<p>After you have crafted the clay models and purchased the tripod, the next step would be to write down a script for the animation. Whether you are creating a short video or a 3-hour long movie, a script will ensure that you don’t miss out on any important scenes while recording the animation. There are multiple script writing software you can find online that’ll speed up the entire process. However, as a beginner, you can also pen down your script in a regular MS Word document. Lack of resources should never come between your creativity.</p>
<p>Once the script is final, the next phase would be to record the <strong>stop motion animation claymation</strong>. This is the stage where you have to be extra careful because you’ll practically be recording the storyline of your animation. Simply fire up the smartphone’s camera and start shooting each frame one-by-one. Keep in mind that shooting a stop motion animation is pretty time-consuming and it can even take up to 5-7 hours to get the job done. So, make sure to grab your cup of coffee and stay patient throughout the process.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Edit-a-Stop-Motion-Claymation-Animation"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Edit-a-Stop-Motion-Claymation-Animation" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How to Edit a Stop Motion Claymation Animation"></a>Part 2 How to Edit a Stop Motion Claymation Animation</h2><p>At this point, you would have several hundred photographs and a script in mind to make your <strong>stop motion claymation</strong>. So, the next part would be to turn these raw images into an animation. To do this, you can use different types of video editing applications. However, we recommend using Wondershare <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> for the job.</p>

<h3 id="02Van-Aken"><a href="#02Van-Aken" class="headerlink" title="02Van Aken"></a>02Van Aken</h3><p>Van Aken is another popular clay brand that’s ideal for <strong>claymation animations</strong>.

Some animators also mix Van Aken with Pupper Putty to make the characters look more stunning under the perfect lighting conditions.</p>
<h3 id="03Sargent-Art"><a href="#03Sargent-Art" class="headerlink" title="03Sargent Art"></a>03Sargent Art</h3><p>Sargent Art is a brand that primarily designs clays for sculpting.

<h3 id="04Sculpey"><a href="#04Sculpey" class="headerlink" title="04Sculpey"></a>04Sculpey</h3><p>Sculpey is a clay brand that designs polymer-based clays that are relatively better than the traditional ceramic mud clays. This type of clay is made up of plastic and it’s comparatively more pliable than any regular clay. And, once you have your sculpture ready, you can simply place the cay model in an oven and make it rock solid within a few minutes.</p>
<h3 id="05Plastilina"><a href="#05Plastilina" class="headerlink" title="05Plastilina"></a>05Plastilina</h3><p>Finally, Plastilina is also a great option for <strong>stop motion claymation</strong> models.

Ideally, if you are an absolute beginner, you would want to start by understanding the dynamics of creating clay models first. Whether you are going to create a animation or a simple stop motion clip, the models will play a major role in the story and it would be important that these models look appealing.</p>
<p>When it comes to capturing the motion, you don’t need any expensive cameras. You can easily shoot the entire motion on your phone as well. Today, even the basic smartphones come with recording features and they are enough to capture the movement of your clay models. However, if you want to keep the production quality as high as possible, make sure to invest in a decent tripod. A tripod will ensure that your <strong>stop motion claymation</strong> doesn’t feel jerky at all.</p>
<p>After you have crafted the clay models and purchased the tripod, the next step would be to write down a script for the animation.

There are multiple script writing software you can find online that’ll speed up the entire process. However, as a beginner, you can also pen down your script in a regular MS Word document. Lack of resources should never come between your creativity.</p>
<p>Once the script is final, the next phase would be to record the <strong>stop motion animation claymation</strong>. This is the stage where you have to be extra careful because you’ll practically be recording the storyline of your animation. Simply fire up the smartphone’s camera and start shooting each frame one-by-one. Keep in mind that shooting a stop motion animation is pretty time-consuming and it can even take up to 5-7 hours to get the job done. So, make sure to grab your cup of coffee and stay patient throughout the process.</p>

<p>Animation is one such aspect that is formed from the integration of several varied factors and processes. One of the most vital ones is the process of rigging. Thus, we will be discussing <strong>Unity character rigging</strong> as Unity is one of the most efficient platforms for animation.</p>
<p>Additionally, we will introduce you to one of the best tools you can use to edit videos and nurture the creative skills you carry in yourself. So, without any further delay, let us start our discussion.</p>
<h4 id="In-this-article-12"><a href="#In-this-article-12" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 [What is Unity Rigging?](#Part 1)</p>
<p>02 [Is It Better to Rig in Unity or Blender?](#Part 2)</p>
<p>03 [How To Use Animation Rigging In Unity](#Part 3)</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Unity-Rigging"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Unity-Rigging" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is Unity Rigging?"></a>Part 1 What is Unity Rigging?</h2><p>To understand what <strong>Unity rigging</strong> is, we must start our discussion first by discussing rigging in animation. In animation, rigging is the process in which your animation characters are separated into two parts. One is the mesh-like structure of the characters. And the other is the skeletal structure given to the characters.</p>
<p>You integrate bones and joints and join them accordingly in the characters present in your animation. It is similar to the presence of the human skeletal system. Moreover, just like the skeletal system in humans helps in the movements of the different parts of the body, the bone and joint structure through rigging also enables the characters in animation to move.</p>
<p>Therefore, we can say that rigging is the process by which you can enable your characters’ in animation to move and show different facial expressions, etc. So, it is obvious that without the process of rigging, the animation is impossible, which makes rigging one of the most crucial aspects of animation.</p>
<p>Now that we know what rigging in animation is, we will be discussing what is <strong>animation rigging in Unity</strong>. Unity technologies have developed a cross-platform gaming engine called ‘Unity’. And this platform also offers the ones interested in animation to learn animation rigging.</p>
<p>The Unity platform offers robust and effective tools for animation rigging. And these tools assist the animators to create real-time rigs in Unity. Most commonly, the set of tools in Unity for rigging is used on the characters. But, if one likes, they can also use the tools on ani Game Object that includes animations and skeletons.</p>
<p>Therefore, when you utilise the platform of Unity or the toolsets of Unity to perform rigging in animation, it can be referred to as <strong>unity rigging</strong>. It is one of the most powerful and renowned platforms for animation, creating the finest and most professional animation creations.</p>

A common question arises as to whether one should choose <strong>blender rigging over Unity</strong> or vice versa. We have laid down the following table to compare the different features of Blender with that of Unity.</p>
<p>| |  Unity            | Blender                                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                         |<br>| ——————- | ————————————————————————————————————————- | ————————————————————————————————————————————— |<br>| <strong>About</strong>           | It is a game engine that enables you in creating human-machine interfaces, AR simulations, customize splash screens, etc. | It is a computer graphics software that is open source and is mainly used for creating 3D models.                                       |<br>| <strong>Types Supported</strong> | Supports 3D                                                                                                               |                                                                                                                                         |<br>| <strong>Best Purpose</strong>    | Ideal for film, architecture, automotive, transportation, and other industries                                            | Ideal for animation and design that assists in VFX, simulation, organizations of all sizes with rendering, modeling, and video editing. |</p>
<p>There are many features that Blender lacks, but Unity includes. The features included in Unity but are absent in Blender are as follows.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Drawing</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Games</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> In-Game Analytics</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Multi-player Gaming Network</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Player Management</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Virtual Reality</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> IT Asset Management</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Prototype Creation</p>
<p>Therefore, it is preferred to opt for <strong>Unity rigging</strong> than Blender rigging, as Blender lacks a considerable number of features.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-How-To-Use-Animation-Rigging-In-Unity"><a href="#Part-3-How-To-Use-Animation-Rigging-In-Unity" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 How To Use Animation Rigging In Unity"></a>Part 3 How To Use Animation Rigging In Unity</h2><p>Now, we will be introducing you to the different steps that will help you in <strong>unity rig animation</strong>. The following list includes the steps in the sequence that, when you deploy, will help you rig in the platform of Unity.</p>
<h5 id="Step-1Installation"><a href="#Step-1Installation" class="headerlink" title="Step 1Installation"></a>Step 1Installation</h5><p>The first step is to install the “<strong>animation rigging package” of Unity</strong>. You will get the animation rigging package in the “Package Manager”. You will be able to avail of this animation package in Unity 2019.1 and above.</p>
<p>This package offers you a library that consists of rig constraints. And this library of rig constraints enables you to create procedural motion during the runtime. And the general term used for this is called “runtime rigging”.</p>
<p>The “Asset’s Animator Root” consist of the “Rig Builder Component”, which is the source where the rigs are accumulated. The rigs here are the constraints put together in groups. With these steps you will be able to create <strong>Unity humanoid rig</strong> that will make your animation creations look the finest, most realistic and most professional.</p>

<h5 id="Step-2Rig-Builder-set-up"><a href="#Step-2Rig-Builder-set-up" class="headerlink" title="Step 2Rig Builder set-up"></a>Step 2Rig Builder set-up</h5><p>After installing the <strong>unity animation rigging package</strong>, the next step is to set up the rig builder. You will have to use the “Animator component” in this step. Using the “Animator component”, integrate the “Rig Builder component” with the “GameObject”. Generally, in the hierarchy of rig, it is the topmost “Transform”.</p>
<p>Then, you will have to make a new child GameObject. To which, you will have to integrate the “Rig component”. After this step, you need to access the “Animator root”, where you will find the “Rig Builder component”. In the “Rig Builder component”, you need to assign the “Rig to the Rig Layers” list.</p>
<p>It will complete the task of creating the most basic rig. The further steps will help you install the required behaviours in the character or characters.</p>

<h5 id="Step-3Bone-Rendering"><a href="#Step-3Bone-Rendering" class="headerlink" title="Step 3Bone Rendering"></a>Step 3Bone Rendering</h5><p>Whether it is <strong>unity rigging</strong> or 3D, bone rendering is the most crucial step to enable your animation characters to gain movement. The “Unity Editor” will help you interact and work with the character’s skeleton in the “Scene view.”</p>
<p>You can add “Transform” lists and then display them in various visual styles with the help of the “Bone Renderer: component. It enables you to integrate numerous “Bone Renderer” components, each of them having its unique style of display. As a result, gameplay debugging, rig setup, keyframing, and other artist workflows are facilitated.</p>

<h5 id="Step-5Managing-the-Rig-Constraints"><a href="#Step-5Managing-the-Rig-Constraints" class="headerlink" title="Step 5Managing the Rig Constraints"></a>Step 5Managing the Rig Constraints</h5><p>Your characters gain “runtime animation” through the rig constraints, and thus, these are the building blocks facilitating assembling the rigs. The rigs are combined in multiple and varied ways to obtain the desired motions and movements in the characters.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Unity-Rigging-1"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Unity-Rigging-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is Unity Rigging?"></a>Part 1 What is Unity Rigging?</h2><p>To understand what <strong>Unity rigging</strong> is, we must start our discussion first by discussing rigging in animation. In animation, rigging is the process in which your animation characters are separated into two parts. One is the mesh-like structure of the characters. And the other is the skeletal structure given to the characters.</p>
<p>You integrate bones and joints and join them accordingly in the characters present in your animation. It is similar to the presence of the human skeletal system. Moreover, just like the skeletal system in humans helps in the movements of the different parts of the body, the bone and joint structure through rigging also enables the characters in animation to move.</p>
<p>Therefore, we can say that rigging is the process by which you can enable your characters’ in animation to move and show different facial expressions, etc. So, it is obvious that without the process of rigging, the animation is impossible, which makes rigging one of the most crucial aspects of animation.</p>
<p>Now that we know what rigging in animation is, we will be discussing what is <strong>animation rigging in Unity</strong>. Unity technologies have developed a cross-platform gaming engine called ‘Unity’. And this platform also offers the ones interested in animation to learn animation rigging.</p>
<p>The Unity platform offers robust and effective tools for animation rigging. And these tools assist the animators to create real-time rigs in Unity. Most commonly, the set of tools in Unity for rigging is used on the characters. But, if one likes, they can also use the tools on ani Game Object that includes animations and skeletons.</p>
<p>Therefore, when you utilise the platform of Unity or the toolsets of Unity to perform rigging in animation, it can be referred to as <strong>unity rigging</strong>. It is one of the most powerful and renowned platforms for animation, creating the finest and most professional animation creations.</p>

<p>There are many features that Blender lacks, but Unity includes. The features included in Unity but are absent in Blender are as follows.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Drawing</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Games</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> In-Game Analytics</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Multi-player Gaming Network</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Player Management</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Virtual Reality</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> IT Asset Management</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Prototype Creation</p>
<p>Therefore, it is preferred to opt for <strong>Unity rigging</strong> than Blender rigging, as Blender lacks a considerable number of features.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-How-To-Use-Animation-Rigging-In-Unity-1"><a href="#Part-3-How-To-Use-Animation-Rigging-In-Unity-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 How To Use Animation Rigging In Unity"></a>Part 3 How To Use Animation Rigging In Unity</h2><p>Now, we will be introducing you to the different steps that will help you in <strong>unity rig animation</strong>. The following list includes the steps in the sequence that, when you deploy, will help you rig in the platform of Unity.</p>
<h5 id="Step-1Installation-1"><a href="#Step-1Installation-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 1Installation"></a>Step 1Installation</h5><p>The first step is to install the “<strong>animation rigging package” of Unity</strong>. You will get the animation rigging package in the “Package Manager”. You will be able to avail of this animation package in Unity 2019.1 and above.</p>
<p>This package offers you a library that consists of rig constraints. And this library of rig constraints enables you to create procedural motion during the runtime. And the general term used for this is called “runtime rigging”.</p>
<p>The “Asset’s Animator Root” consist of the “Rig Builder Component”, which is the source where the rigs are accumulated. The rigs here are the constraints put together in groups. With these steps you will be able to create <strong>Unity humanoid rig</strong> that will make your animation creations look the finest, most realistic and most professional.</p>

<h5 id="Step-2Rig-Builder-set-up-1"><a href="#Step-2Rig-Builder-set-up-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 2Rig Builder set-up"></a>Step 2Rig Builder set-up</h5><p>After installing the <strong>unity animation rigging package</strong>, the next step is to set up the rig builder. You will have to use the “Animator component” in this step. Using the “Animator component”, integrate the “Rig Builder component” with the “GameObject”. Generally, in the hierarchy of rig, it is the topmost “Transform”.</p>
<p>Then, you will have to make a new child GameObject. To which, you will have to integrate the “Rig component”. After this step, you need to access the “Animator root”, where you will find the “Rig Builder component”. In the “Rig Builder component”, you need to assign the “Rig to the Rig Layers” list.</p>
<p>It will complete the task of creating the most basic rig. The further steps will help you install the required behaviours in the character or characters.</p>

<h5 id="Step-3Bone-Rendering-1"><a href="#Step-3Bone-Rendering-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 3Bone Rendering"></a>Step 3Bone Rendering</h5><p>Whether it is <strong>unity rigging</strong> or 3D, bone rendering is the most crucial step to enable your animation characters to gain movement. The “Unity Editor” will help you interact and work with the character’s skeleton in the “Scene view.”</p>
<p>You can add “Transform” lists and then display them in various visual styles with the help of the “Bone Renderer: component. It enables you to integrate numerous “Bone Renderer” components, each of them having its unique style of display. As a result, gameplay debugging, rig setup, keyframing, and other artist workflows are facilitated.</p>

<h5 id="Step-5Managing-the-Rig-Constraints-1"><a href="#Step-5Managing-the-Rig-Constraints-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 5Managing the Rig Constraints"></a>Step 5Managing the Rig Constraints</h5><p>Your characters gain “runtime animation” through the rig constraints, and thus, these are the building blocks facilitating assembling the rigs. The rigs are combined in multiple and varied ways to obtain the desired motions and movements in the characters.</p>

The following list includes the steps in the sequence that, when you deploy, will help you rig in the platform of Unity.</p>
<h5 id="Step-1Installation-2"><a href="#Step-1Installation-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 1Installation"></a>Step 1Installation</h5><p>The first step is to install the “<strong>animation rigging package” of Unity</strong>. You will get the animation rigging package in the “Package Manager”. You will be able to avail of this animation package in Unity 2019.1 and above.</p>
<p>This package offers you a library that consists of rig constraints. And this library of rig constraints enables you to create procedural motion during the runtime. And the general term used for this is called “runtime rigging”.</p>
<p>The “Asset’s Animator Root” consist of the “Rig Builder Component”, which is the source where the rigs are accumulated. The rigs here are the constraints put together in groups.

<h5 id="Step-2Rig-Builder-set-up-2"><a href="#Step-2Rig-Builder-set-up-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 2Rig Builder set-up"></a>Step 2Rig Builder set-up</h5><p>After installing the <strong>unity animation rigging package</strong>, the next step is to set up the rig builder. You will have to use the “Animator component” in this step. Using the “Animator component”, integrate the “Rig Builder component” with the “GameObject”. Generally, in the hierarchy of rig, it is the topmost “Transform”.</p>
<p>Then, you will have to make a new child GameObject. To which, you will have to integrate the “Rig component”. After this step, you need to access the “Animator root”, where you will find the “Rig Builder component”. In the “Rig Builder component”, you need to assign the “Rig to the Rig Layers” list.</p>
<p>It will complete the task of creating the most basic rig. The further steps will help you install the required behaviours in the character or characters.</p>

<h5 id="Step-3Bone-Rendering-2"><a href="#Step-3Bone-Rendering-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 3Bone Rendering"></a>Step 3Bone Rendering</h5><p>Whether it is <strong>unity rigging</strong> or 3D, bone rendering is the most crucial step to enable your animation characters to gain movement. The “Unity Editor” will help you interact and work with the character’s skeleton in the “Scene view.”</p>
<p>You can add “Transform” lists and then display them in various visual styles with the help of the “Bone Renderer: component. It enables you to integrate numerous “Bone Renderer” components, each of them having its unique style of display. As a result, gameplay debugging, rig setup, keyframing, and other artist workflows are facilitated.</p>

<p>Animation is one such aspect that is formed from the integration of several varied factors and processes. One of the most vital ones is the process of rigging. Thus, we will be discussing <strong>Unity character rigging</strong> as Unity is one of the most efficient platforms for animation.</p>
<p>Additionally, we will introduce you to one of the best tools you can use to edit videos and nurture the creative skills you carry in yourself. So, without any further delay, let us start our discussion.</p>
<h4 id="In-this-article-15"><a href="#In-this-article-15" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 [What is Unity Rigging?](#Part 1)</p>
<p>02 [Is It Better to Rig in Unity or Blender?](#Part 2)</p>
<p>03 [How To Use Animation Rigging In Unity](#Part 3)</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Unity-Rigging-3"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Unity-Rigging-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is Unity Rigging?"></a>Part 1 What is Unity Rigging?</h2><p>To understand what <strong>Unity rigging</strong> is, we must start our discussion first by discussing rigging in animation. In animation, rigging is the process in which your animation characters are separated into two parts. One is the mesh-like structure of the characters. And the other is the skeletal structure given to the characters.</p>
<p>You integrate bones and joints and join them accordingly in the characters present in your animation. It is similar to the presence of the human skeletal system. Moreover, just like the skeletal system in humans helps in the movements of the different parts of the body, the bone and joint structure through rigging also enables the characters in animation to move.</p>
<p>Therefore, we can say that rigging is the process by which you can enable your characters’ in animation to move and show different facial expressions, etc. So, it is obvious that without the process of rigging, the animation is impossible, which makes rigging one of the most crucial aspects of animation.</p>
<p>Now that we know what rigging in animation is, we will be discussing what is <strong>animation rigging in Unity</strong>. Unity technologies have developed a cross-platform gaming engine called ‘Unity’. And this platform also offers the ones interested in animation to learn animation rigging.</p>
<p>The Unity platform offers robust and effective tools for animation rigging. And these tools assist the animators to create real-time rigs in Unity. Most commonly, the set of tools in Unity for rigging is used on the characters. But, if one likes, they can also use the tools on ani Game Object that includes animations and skeletons.</p>
<p>Therefore, when you utilise the platform of Unity or the toolsets of Unity to perform rigging in animation, it can be referred to as <strong>unity rigging</strong>. It is one of the most powerful and renowned platforms for animation, creating the finest and most professional animation creations.</p>

<h5 id="Step-3Bone-Rendering-3"><a href="#Step-3Bone-Rendering-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 3Bone Rendering"></a>Step 3Bone Rendering</h5><p>Whether it is <strong>unity rigging</strong> or 3D, bone rendering is the most crucial step to enable your animation characters to gain movement. The “Unity Editor” will help you interact and work with the character’s skeleton in the “Scene view.”</p>
<p>You can add “Transform” lists and then display them in various visual styles with the help of the “Bone Renderer: component. It enables you to integrate numerous “Bone Renderer” components, each of them having its unique style of display. As a result, gameplay debugging, rig setup, keyframing, and other artist workflows are facilitated.</p>
