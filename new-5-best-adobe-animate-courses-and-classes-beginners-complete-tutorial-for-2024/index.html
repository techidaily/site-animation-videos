You can use a <strong>skeleton cartoon</strong> to add a quirky effect to your project. You can draw an animated skeleton on your favorite t-shirt and change the vibe of the t-shirt. There are many methods to draw <strong>skeleton cartoon</strong>. Here we focus mainly on one way to draw cartoon skeleton. The method might seem difficult at the beginning, but the whole process becomes easier and smooth once you start following the steps. The steps are:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> To start with the drawing of the skeleton, let’s start with the head or the skull. The head should be round, and the jaw area needs to be at some angle or angular and have smaller lines than the long rounded lines on the upper part of the skull.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> The mouth of the skull must be open, and then we need to concentrate on other features of the face like the teeth, nose, and cheekbone.</p>

                      alt="start with head skeleton cartoon"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> After the head is complete, we focus on the neck and the chest area. To draw the neck, divide the neck into small sections to show the division in the neck portion, as shown in the picture.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> To start with the rib cage, we need to draw the spine. The spine can be drawn as a long thick line and should be a continuity of the neck, so the neck and the spine should be drawn in the same way and same line. It is to be drawn at the body’s center, just below the head. You can refer to the example as shown below.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> After you have drawn the spine, to draw the rib, draw circles around the spine as if the curved lines demonstrating the rib are revolving around the spine.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="draw ribs skeleton cartoon"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> After the head and the chest region is complete. Focus on the hand. You can rest the arms any way you want. Since you are a beginner, this example shows the easiest ways to rest the hands when you are drawing a cartoon skeleton.</p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> The left arm will rest on the hips, and the right arm needs to be shown in a way so that it looks that the skeleton body is leaning on some object.</p>
<p><strong>Step 8:</strong> Since the arms have divisions, the bones must be drawn the same way shown in the example with the same divisions on the arms.</p>
<p><strong>Step 9:</strong> Keep in mind that both the arms must have equal bone divisions; otherwise, the drawing may look weird.</p>
<p><strong>Step 10:</strong> Now you need to draw the hand. The hand is made of small bones. To draw the hand, divide it into small sections consisting of very small bones.</p>

                      alt="draw arms skeleton cartoon"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 11:</strong> After the hands are complete, the upper part of the body is complete. Now we need to focus on the lower part of the body.</p>
<p><strong>Step 12:</strong> To start with the lower part of the body, we start with the hip portion.</p>
<p><strong>Step 13:</strong> Show the hips with curved lines, and draw a round-like shape inside the curve to show the holes in the hips.</p>
<p><strong>Step 14:</strong> After the hip is complete, start with the upper half of the legs. Draw a long bone from the hip to demonstrate the upper part of the leg.</p>

                      alt="draw upper half of the legs"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 15:</strong> Now we need to concentrate on the other half of the leg. You can position the legs any way you want. Here in the example, the left leg will be crossed over the right leg.</p>
<p><strong>Step 16:</strong> After the lower half of the legs is complete, the standing posture of the skeleton is set.</p>
<p><strong>Step 17:</strong> Now we need to add the feet at the end of the leg. The feet are made of tiny pieces of bones; to draw the feet, divide them into small sections, as shown in the example.</p>
<p><strong>Step 18:</strong> Draw the feet in a similar way to how you have drawn the hands.</p>

You can use a <strong>skeleton cartoon</strong> to add a quirky effect to your project. You can draw an animated skeleton on your favorite t-shirt and change the vibe of the t-shirt. There are many methods to draw <strong>skeleton cartoon</strong>. Here we focus mainly on one way to draw cartoon skeleton. The method might seem difficult at the beginning, but the whole process becomes easier and smooth once you start following the steps. The steps are:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> To start with the drawing of the skeleton, let’s start with the head or the skull. The head should be round, and the jaw area needs to be at some angle or angular and have smaller lines than the long rounded lines on the upper part of the skull.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> The mouth of the skull must be open, and then we need to concentrate on other features of the face like the teeth, nose, and cheekbone.</p>

                      alt="start with head skeleton cartoon"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> After the head is complete, we focus on the neck and the chest area. To draw the neck, divide the neck into small sections to show the division in the neck portion, as shown in the picture.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> To start with the rib cage, we need to draw the spine. The spine can be drawn as a long thick line and should be a continuity of the neck, so the neck and the spine should be drawn in the same way and same line. It is to be drawn at the body’s center, just below the head. You can refer to the example as shown below.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> After you have drawn the spine, to draw the rib, draw circles around the spine as if the curved lines demonstrating the rib are revolving around the spine.</p>

                      alt="draw ribs skeleton cartoon"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> After the head and the chest region is complete. Focus on the hand. You can rest the arms any way you want. Since you are a beginner, this example shows the easiest ways to rest the hands when you are drawing a cartoon skeleton.</p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> The left arm will rest on the hips, and the right arm needs to be shown in a way so that it looks that the skeleton body is leaning on some object.</p>
<p><strong>Step 8:</strong> Since the arms have divisions, the bones must be drawn the same way shown in the example with the same divisions on the arms.</p>
<p><strong>Step 9:</strong> Keep in mind that both the arms must have equal bone divisions; otherwise, the drawing may look weird.</p>
<p><strong>Step 10:</strong> Now you need to draw the hand. The hand is made of small bones. To draw the hand, divide it into small sections consisting of very small bones.</p>

                      alt="draw arms skeleton cartoon"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 11:</strong> After the hands are complete, the upper part of the body is complete. Now we need to focus on the lower part of the body.</p>
<p><strong>Step 12:</strong> To start with the lower part of the body, we start with the hip portion.</p>
<p><strong>Step 13:</strong> Show the hips with curved lines, and draw a round-like shape inside the curve to show the holes in the hips.</p>
<p><strong>Step 14:</strong> After the hip is complete, start with the upper half of the legs. Draw a long bone from the hip to demonstrate the upper part of the leg.</p>

                      alt="draw upper half of the legs"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 15:</strong> Now we need to concentrate on the other half of the leg. You can position the legs any way you want. Here in the example, the left leg will be crossed over the right leg.</p>
<p><strong>Step 16:</strong> After the lower half of the legs is complete, the standing posture of the skeleton is set.</p>
<p><strong>Step 17:</strong> Now we need to add the feet at the end of the leg. The feet are made of tiny pieces of bones; to draw the feet, divide them into small sections, as shown in the example.</p>
<p><strong>Step 18:</strong> Draw the feet in a similar way to how you have drawn the hands.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 11:</strong> After the hands are complete, the upper part of the body is complete. Now we need to focus on the lower part of the body.</p>
<p><strong>Step 12:</strong> To start with the lower part of the body, we start with the hip portion.</p>
<p><strong>Step 13:</strong> Show the hips with curved lines, and draw a round-like shape inside the curve to show the holes in the hips.</p>
<p><strong>Step 14:</strong> After the hip is complete, start with the upper half of the legs. Draw a long bone from the hip to demonstrate the upper part of the leg.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 15:</strong> Now we need to concentrate on the other half of the leg. You can position the legs any way you want. Here in the example, the left leg will be crossed over the right leg.</p>
<p><strong>Step 16:</strong> After the lower half of the legs is complete, the standing posture of the skeleton is set.</p>
<p><strong>Step 17:</strong> Now we need to add the feet at the end of the leg. The feet are made of tiny pieces of bones; to draw the feet, divide them into small sections, as shown in the example.</p>
<p><strong>Step 18:</strong> Draw the feet in a similar way to how you have drawn the hands.</p>

You can use a <strong>skeleton cartoon</strong> to add a quirky effect to your project. You can draw an animated skeleton on your favorite t-shirt and change the vibe of the t-shirt. There are many methods to draw <strong>skeleton cartoon</strong>. Here we focus mainly on one way to draw cartoon skeleton. The method might seem difficult at the beginning, but the whole process becomes easier and smooth once you start following the steps. The steps are:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> To start with the drawing of the skeleton, let’s start with the head or the skull. The head should be round, and the jaw area needs to be at some angle or angular and have smaller lines than the long rounded lines on the upper part of the skull.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> The mouth of the skull must be open, and then we need to concentrate on other features of the face like the teeth, nose, and cheekbone.</p>

                      alt="start with head skeleton cartoon"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> After the head is complete, we focus on the neck and the chest area. To draw the neck, divide the neck into small sections to show the division in the neck portion, as shown in the picture.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> To start with the rib cage, we need to draw the spine. The spine can be drawn as a long thick line and should be a continuity of the neck, so the neck and the spine should be drawn in the same way and same line. It is to be drawn at the body’s center, just below the head. You can refer to the example as shown below.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> After you have drawn the spine, to draw the rib, draw circles around the spine as if the curved lines demonstrating the rib are revolving around the spine.</p>

                      alt="draw ribs skeleton cartoon"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> After the head and the chest region is complete. Focus on the hand. You can rest the arms any way you want. Since you are a beginner, this example shows the easiest ways to rest the hands when you are drawing a cartoon skeleton.</p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> The left arm will rest on the hips, and the right arm needs to be shown in a way so that it looks that the skeleton body is leaning on some object.</p>
<p><strong>Step 8:</strong> Since the arms have divisions, the bones must be drawn the same way shown in the example with the same divisions on the arms.</p>
<p><strong>Step 9:</strong> Keep in mind that both the arms must have equal bone divisions; otherwise, the drawing may look weird.</p>
<p><strong>Step 10:</strong> Now you need to draw the hand. The hand is made of small bones. To draw the hand, divide it into small sections consisting of very small bones.</p>

                      alt="draw arms skeleton cartoon"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 11:</strong> After the hands are complete, the upper part of the body is complete. Now we need to focus on the lower part of the body.</p>
<p><strong>Step 12:</strong> To start with the lower part of the body, we start with the hip portion.</p>
<p><strong>Step 13:</strong> Show the hips with curved lines, and draw a round-like shape inside the curve to show the holes in the hips.</p>
<p><strong>Step 14:</strong> After the hip is complete, start with the upper half of the legs. Draw a long bone from the hip to demonstrate the upper part of the leg.</p>

<p><strong>Step 15:</strong> Now we need to concentrate on the other half of the leg. You can position the legs any way you want. Here in the example, the left leg will be crossed over the right leg.</p>
<p><strong>Step 16:</strong> After the lower half of the legs is complete, the standing posture of the skeleton is set.</p>
<p><strong>Step 17:</strong> Now we need to add the feet at the end of the leg. The feet are made of tiny pieces of bones; to draw the feet, divide them into small sections, as shown in the example.</p>
<p><strong>Step 18:</strong> Draw the feet in a similar way to how you have drawn the hands.</p>

<p><strong>Cartoon painting</strong> is slowly becoming popular due to its many benefits, especially <strong>easy cartoon canvas painting</strong>. For instance, it is pretty eye-grabbing, especially if your audience is children.</p>

<p>Thanks to the animation aspect, it has become relatively cheap to do advertisements with cartoons instead of real people.</p>
<h4 id="In-this-article-12"><a href="#In-this-article-12" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 [What Are Good Cartoons to Draw?](#Part 1)</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-Are-Good-Cartoons-to-Draw"><a href="#Part-1-What-Are-Good-Cartoons-to-Draw" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What Are Good Cartoons to Draw?"></a>Part 1 What Are Good Cartoons to Draw?</h2><p>As far as good cartoons are concerned, expect about 5 popular types. These <strong>cartoons to draw</strong> include:</p>
<h3 id="01-Illustrative-Cartoons"><a href="#01-Illustrative-Cartoons" class="headerlink" title="01 Illustrative Cartoons"></a>01 Illustrative Cartoons</h3><p>They are the most suitable cartoons to draw when portraying particular ideas directly and simply.</p>
<p>The cartoons are primarily used in advertisements, teaching aids, and explaining stories. They also have text that explains them further.</p>
<p>It explains why they are common in school books, making them perfect for explaining content or subject.</p>
<p><img

<h3 id="02-Animated-Cartoons"><a href="#02-Animated-Cartoons" class="headerlink" title="02 Animated Cartoons"></a>02 Animated Cartoons</h3><p>It is important to note that these cartoons are drawn using computers despite looking as if they are hand-drawn. One thing that makes them stand out is that they seem to be in action and movement.</p>
<p>As much as that’s how they seem from the viewer’s perspective, that’s far from the truth. They are just drawn in series, and since the first one will differ from the second one, there is that illusion of movement created.</p>

<h3 id="03-Comic-Strips-or-Panels"><a href="#03-Comic-Strips-or-Panels" class="headerlink" title="03 Comic Strips or Panels"></a>03 Comic Strips or Panels</h3><p>In most cases, these are regular features characterized by established or known characters and usually displayed in newspapers.</p>
<p>Just like the animated cartoons, they are showcased in series to tell or illustrate a story. The series of panels have words said by the various characters.</p>
<p>The words are usually in balloons, and a single comic strip may cover a single or double page of a newspaper.</p>

<h3 id="04-Gag-Cartoons"><a href="#04-Gag-Cartoons" class="headerlink" title="04 Gag Cartoons"></a>04 Gag Cartoons</h3><p>As the name gag suggests, these cartoons revolve around jokes. These single-paneled cartoons often make fun of human beings.</p>
<p>Through overstatements, humor resonates from what is drawn. They can either serve as entertainment or point out, if not make fun of, people, especially their mistakes and faults. Besides the cartoon, expect a caption that’s often a single sentence.</p>

<h3 id="05-Editorial-or-Political-Cartoons"><a href="#05-Editorial-or-Political-Cartoons" class="headerlink" title="05 Editorial or Political Cartoons"></a>05 Editorial or Political Cartoons</h3><p>These cartoons are also made for the newspapers. Expect them to be a single drawing on an editorial page. It sheds more light on a particular newspaper’s editorial comment.</p>
<p>As much as some have captions, that’s not always the case. Just like the gag cartoons, they ridicule people, but the editorial ones focus on celebrities.</p>

So, feel encouraged because you stand a chance also to become an expert in the long run. All you need to do is take the first step. Fortunately, we are here to hold your hand as you do so. So. Without further ado, let’s get started.</p>
<h3 id="01-Cartoon-Painting-of-a-Young-Character"><a href="#01-Cartoon-Painting-of-a-Young-Character" class="headerlink" title="01 Cartoon Painting of a Young Character"></a>01 Cartoon Painting of a Young Character</h3><p><strong>These are the steps you need to follow when doing so:</strong></p>
<h5 id="Step-1Start-with-the-face"><a href="#Step-1Start-with-the-face" class="headerlink" title="Step 1Start with the face"></a>Step 1Start with the face</h5><p>The face is significant, especially when it comes to cartoon painting. It has complex as well as simple parts. For example, the face itself is pretty basic since you will need to begin with a circle.</p>
<p>After that, draw a horizontal and vertical line and ensure that they intersect in the middle.</p>

<h5 id="Step-2Draw-the-eyes-by-drawing"><a href="#Step-2Draw-the-eyes-by-drawing" class="headerlink" title="Step 2Draw the eyes by drawing"></a>Step 2Draw the eyes by drawing</h5><p>Draw the eyes by drawing an oval and ensuring that the top side is slightly tilting to the side.</p>
<p>Do the same thing on the other side since the norm is a pair of eyes. The gap between the two should also be sensible.</p>
<p><img

                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<h5 id="Step-3Draw-eyebrows"><a href="#Step-3Draw-eyebrows" class="headerlink" title="Step 3Draw eyebrows"></a>Step 3Draw eyebrows</h5><p>On the upper side of the eye, ensure that the lines are slightly thick. The eyebrows also need to be placed above the eyes, slightly above the thick line representing the eyelashes.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<h5 id="Step-4Draw-jaw"><a href="#Step-4Draw-jaw" class="headerlink" title="Step 4Draw jaw"></a>Step 4Draw jaw</h5><p>After that, start shaping the jaw. Keep in mind that it plays a huge role in determining whether the character will look thin or fat. Additionally, how you draw the jaw determines whether the character will be old or young and how old or young the person will look.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<h5 id="Step-5Draw-nose"><a href="#Step-5Draw-nose" class="headerlink" title="Step 5Draw nose"></a>Step 5Draw nose</h5><p>Design the nose and ensure that you don’t put many details. The good thing about the nose is that a tip is enough to serve the purpose. Another common approach when drawing the nose is doing so as if you are viewing it from the side.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Draw nose"
                ></p>
<h5 id="Step-6Draw-mouth"><a href="#Step-6Draw-mouth" class="headerlink" title="Step 6Draw mouth"></a>Step 6Draw mouth</h5><p>Next, draw the mouth and consider the age of your character as you do so. If it is a child, despite the gender, stick to simplicity. You should also avoid drawing the lips. Preferably, go for the good, expressive trace since it never disappoints.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<h5 id="Step-7Draw-ears"><a href="#Step-7Draw-ears" class="headerlink" title="Step 7Draw ears"></a>Step 7Draw ears</h5><p>Proceed to the ears and in relation to whether the character is facing the camera or not. If your character is looking at the camera, you should see the front side view. Therefore, it won’t make sense to display the internal cavities in this case.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/in-depth-study-of-cartoon-painting-starts-from-learning-to-draw-it-12.jpg"
                      alt="Draw ears"
                ></p>
<h5 id="Step-8Draw-haircut"><a href="#Step-8Draw-haircut" class="headerlink" title="Step 8Draw haircut"></a>Step 8Draw haircut</h5><p>Proceed to the ears and in relation to whether the character is facing the camera or not. If your character is looking at the camera, you should see the front side view. Therefore, it won’t make sense to display the internal cavities in this case.</p>
<p>As scary as it may look, you need not be an expert to make the haircut look perfect. Additionally, there is no constant way of drawing the haircut, and you are at liberty to practice as much creativity as possible.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, please don’t take it lightly since it can be quite descriptive. For instance, the hair is used to tell the personality of a character. Practice makes perfect, and you better keep doing it until you get it right. Ensure that what you draw shows the age and character of the cartoons to draw as perfectly as possible.</p>
<p>So far, our focus has been on a young character. However, that’s not always the case explaining why we will look at a cartoon painting of an old character.</p>

Start with the eyes and add their pupils, eyebrows and don’t forget to add wrinkles.</p>
<p>Since the character is old compared to the previous one, ensure that the eyebrows are thick. They should occupy more space of the forehead.</p>

So, what do you do if you want to create a female one instead? These are some of the steps to follow as you do so.</p>
<p>The procedure is not that different. However, consider that women’s facial structures are more delicate than those of their male counterparts. Some of the things that stand out include long hair, a small nose, a thin chin, thin eyebrows, and large, expressive eyelashes. Large pupils will also do, especially if you are good at drawing.</p>

<p>Thanks to the animation aspect, it has become relatively cheap to do advertisements with cartoons instead of real people.</p>

These <strong>cartoons to draw</strong> include:</p>
<h3 id="01-Illustrative-Cartoons-1"><a href="#01-Illustrative-Cartoons-1" class="headerlink" title="01 Illustrative Cartoons"></a>01 Illustrative Cartoons</h3><p>They are the most suitable cartoons to draw when portraying particular ideas directly and simply.</p>
<p>The cartoons are primarily used in advertisements, teaching aids, and explaining stories. They also have text that explains them further.</p>
<p>It explains why they are common in school books, making them perfect for explaining content or subject.</p>

<h3 id="02-Animated-Cartoons-1"><a href="#02-Animated-Cartoons-1" class="headerlink" title="02 Animated Cartoons"></a>02 Animated Cartoons</h3><p>It is important to note that these cartoons are drawn using computers despite looking as if they are hand-drawn. One thing that makes them stand out is that they seem to be in action and movement.</p>
<p>As much as that’s how they seem from the viewer’s perspective, that’s far from the truth. They are just drawn in series, and since the first one will differ from the second one, there is that illusion of movement created.</p>

<p>Just like the animated cartoons, they are showcased in series to tell or illustrate a story. The series of panels have words said by the various characters.</p>
<p>The words are usually in balloons, and a single comic strip may cover a single or double page of a newspaper.</p>

<h3 id="04-Gag-Cartoons-1"><a href="#04-Gag-Cartoons-1" class="headerlink" title="04 Gag Cartoons"></a>04 Gag Cartoons</h3><p>As the name gag suggests, these cartoons revolve around jokes. These single-paneled cartoons often make fun of human beings.</p>
<p>Through overstatements, humor resonates from what is drawn. They can either serve as entertainment or point out, if not make fun of, people, especially their mistakes and faults. Besides the cartoon, expect a caption that’s often a single sentence.</p>

Expect them to be a single drawing on an editorial page. It sheds more light on a particular newspaper’s editorial comment.</p>
<p>As much as some have captions, that’s not always the case. Just like the gag cartoons, they ridicule people, but the editorial ones focus on celebrities.</p>

So, feel encouraged because you stand a chance also to become an expert in the long run. All you need to do is take the first step. Fortunately, we are here to hold your hand as you do so. So. Without further ado, let’s get started.</p>
<h3 id="01-Cartoon-Painting-of-a-Young-Character-1"><a href="#01-Cartoon-Painting-of-a-Young-Character-1" class="headerlink" title="01 Cartoon Painting of a Young Character"></a>01 Cartoon Painting of a Young Character</h3><p><strong>These are the steps you need to follow when doing so:</strong></p>
<h5 id="Step-1Start-with-the-face-1"><a href="#Step-1Start-with-the-face-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 1Start with the face"></a>Step 1Start with the face</h5><p>The face is significant, especially when it comes to cartoon painting. It has complex as well as simple parts. For example, the face itself is pretty basic since you will need to begin with a circle.</p>
<p>After that, draw a horizontal and vertical line and ensure that they intersect in the middle.</p>
<p><img

<p>Do the same thing on the other side since the norm is a pair of eyes. The gap between the two should also be sensible.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<h5 id="Step-3Draw-eyebrows-1"><a href="#Step-3Draw-eyebrows-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 3Draw eyebrows"></a>Step 3Draw eyebrows</h5><p>On the upper side of the eye, ensure that the lines are slightly thick. The eyebrows also need to be placed above the eyes, slightly above the thick line representing the eyelashes.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

<h5 id="Step-4Draw-jaw-1"><a href="#Step-4Draw-jaw-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 4Draw jaw"></a>Step 4Draw jaw</h5><p>After that, start shaping the jaw. Keep in mind that it plays a huge role in determining whether the character will look thin or fat. Additionally, how you draw the jaw determines whether the character will be old or young and how old or young the person will look.</p>

<h5 id="Step-5Draw-nose-1"><a href="#Step-5Draw-nose-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 5Draw nose"></a>Step 5Draw nose</h5><p>Design the nose and ensure that you don’t put many details. The good thing about the nose is that a tip is enough to serve the purpose. Another common approach when drawing the nose is doing so as if you are viewing it from the side.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<h5 id="Step-6Draw-mouth-1"><a href="#Step-6Draw-mouth-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 6Draw mouth"></a>Step 6Draw mouth</h5><p>Next, draw the mouth and consider the age of your character as you do so. If it is a child, despite the gender, stick to simplicity. You should also avoid drawing the lips. Preferably, go for the good, expressive trace since it never disappoints.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<h5 id="Step-7Draw-ears-1"><a href="#Step-7Draw-ears-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 7Draw ears"></a>Step 7Draw ears</h5><p>Proceed to the ears and in relation to whether the character is facing the camera or not. If your character is looking at the camera, you should see the front side view. Therefore, it won’t make sense to display the internal cavities in this case.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<h5 id="Step-8Draw-haircut-1"><a href="#Step-8Draw-haircut-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 8Draw haircut"></a>Step 8Draw haircut</h5><p>Proceed to the ears and in relation to whether the character is facing the camera or not. If your character is looking at the camera, you should see the front side view. Therefore, it won’t make sense to display the internal cavities in this case.</p>
<p>As scary as it may look, you need not be an expert to make the haircut look perfect. Additionally, there is no constant way of drawing the haircut, and you are at liberty to practice as much creativity as possible.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, please don’t take it lightly since it can be quite descriptive. For instance, the hair is used to tell the personality of a character. Practice makes perfect, and you better keep doing it until you get it right. Ensure that what you draw shows the age and character of the cartoons to draw as perfectly as possible.</p>
<p>So far, our focus has been on a young character. However, that’s not always the case explaining why we will look at a cartoon painting of an old character.</p>

Start with the eyes and add their pupils, eyebrows and don’t forget to add wrinkles.</p>
<p>Since the character is old compared to the previous one, ensure that the eyebrows are thick. They should occupy more space of the forehead.</p>

<p>The procedure is not that different. However, consider that women’s facial structures are more delicate than those of their male counterparts.

<p><strong>Cartoon painting</strong> is slowly becoming popular due to its many benefits, especially <strong>easy cartoon canvas painting</strong>. For instance, it is pretty eye-grabbing, especially if your audience is children.</p>

<p>Thanks to the animation aspect, it has become relatively cheap to do advertisements with cartoons instead of real people.</p>

These <strong>cartoons to draw</strong> include:</p>
<h3 id="01-Illustrative-Cartoons-2"><a href="#01-Illustrative-Cartoons-2" class="headerlink" title="01 Illustrative Cartoons"></a>01 Illustrative Cartoons</h3><p>They are the most suitable cartoons to draw when portraying particular ideas directly and simply.</p>
<p>The cartoons are primarily used in advertisements, teaching aids, and explaining stories. They also have text that explains them further.</p>
<p>It explains why they are common in school books, making them perfect for explaining content or subject.</p>

<h3 id="02-Animated-Cartoons-2"><a href="#02-Animated-Cartoons-2" class="headerlink" title="02 Animated Cartoons"></a>02 Animated Cartoons</h3><p>It is important to note that these cartoons are drawn using computers despite looking as if they are hand-drawn. One thing that makes them stand out is that they seem to be in action and movement.</p>
<p>As much as that’s how they seem from the viewer’s perspective, that’s far from the truth. They are just drawn in series, and since the first one will differ from the second one, there is that illusion of movement created.</p>

<p>Just like the animated cartoons, they are showcased in series to tell or illustrate a story. The series of panels have words said by the various characters.</p>
<p>The words are usually in balloons, and a single comic strip may cover a single or double page of a newspaper.</p>

<h3 id="04-Gag-Cartoons-2"><a href="#04-Gag-Cartoons-2" class="headerlink" title="04 Gag Cartoons"></a>04 Gag Cartoons</h3><p>As the name gag suggests, these cartoons revolve around jokes. These single-paneled cartoons often make fun of human beings.</p>
<p>Through overstatements, humor resonates from what is drawn. They can either serve as entertainment or point out, if not make fun of, people, especially their mistakes and faults. Besides the cartoon, expect a caption that’s often a single sentence.</p>

Expect them to be a single drawing on an editorial page. It sheds more light on a particular newspaper’s editorial comment.</p>
<p>As much as some have captions, that’s not always the case. Just like the gag cartoons, they ridicule people, but the editorial ones focus on celebrities.</p>

So, feel encouraged because you stand a chance also to become an expert in the long run. All you need to do is take the first step. Fortunately, we are here to hold your hand as you do so. So. Without further ado, let’s get started.</p>
<h3 id="01-Cartoon-Painting-of-a-Young-Character-2"><a href="#01-Cartoon-Painting-of-a-Young-Character-2" class="headerlink" title="01 Cartoon Painting of a Young Character"></a>01 Cartoon Painting of a Young Character</h3><p><strong>These are the steps you need to follow when doing so:</strong></p>
<h5 id="Step-1Start-with-the-face-2"><a href="#Step-1Start-with-the-face-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 1Start with the face"></a>Step 1Start with the face</h5><p>The face is significant, especially when it comes to cartoon painting. It has complex as well as simple parts. For example, the face itself is pretty basic since you will need to begin with a circle.</p>
<p>After that, draw a horizontal and vertical line and ensure that they intersect in the middle.</p>

<h5 id="Step-2Draw-the-eyes-by-drawing-2"><a href="#Step-2Draw-the-eyes-by-drawing-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 2Draw the eyes by drawing"></a>Step 2Draw the eyes by drawing</h5><p>Draw the eyes by drawing an oval and ensuring that the top side is slightly tilting to the side.</p>
<p>Do the same thing on the other side since the norm is a pair of eyes. The gap between the two should also be sensible.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<h5 id="Step-3Draw-eyebrows-2"><a href="#Step-3Draw-eyebrows-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 3Draw eyebrows"></a>Step 3Draw eyebrows</h5><p>On the upper side of the eye, ensure that the lines are slightly thick. The eyebrows also need to be placed above the eyes, slightly above the thick line representing the eyelashes.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

<h5 id="Step-4Draw-jaw-2"><a href="#Step-4Draw-jaw-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 4Draw jaw"></a>Step 4Draw jaw</h5><p>After that, start shaping the jaw. Keep in mind that it plays a huge role in determining whether the character will look thin or fat. Additionally, how you draw the jaw determines whether the character will be old or young and how old or young the person will look.</p>

<h5 id="Step-5Draw-nose-2"><a href="#Step-5Draw-nose-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 5Draw nose"></a>Step 5Draw nose</h5><p>Design the nose and ensure that you don’t put many details. The good thing about the nose is that a tip is enough to serve the purpose. Another common approach when drawing the nose is doing so as if you are viewing it from the side.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<h5 id="Step-6Draw-mouth-2"><a href="#Step-6Draw-mouth-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 6Draw mouth"></a>Step 6Draw mouth</h5><p>Next, draw the mouth and consider the age of your character as you do so. If it is a child, despite the gender, stick to simplicity. You should also avoid drawing the lips. Preferably, go for the good, expressive trace since it never disappoints.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<h5 id="Step-7Draw-ears-2"><a href="#Step-7Draw-ears-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 7Draw ears"></a>Step 7Draw ears</h5><p>Proceed to the ears and in relation to whether the character is facing the camera or not. If your character is looking at the camera, you should see the front side view. Therefore, it won’t make sense to display the internal cavities in this case.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<h5 id="Step-8Draw-haircut-2"><a href="#Step-8Draw-haircut-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 8Draw haircut"></a>Step 8Draw haircut</h5><p>Proceed to the ears and in relation to whether the character is facing the camera or not. If your character is looking at the camera, you should see the front side view. Therefore, it won’t make sense to display the internal cavities in this case.</p>
<p>As scary as it may look, you need not be an expert to make the haircut look perfect. Additionally, there is no constant way of drawing the haircut, and you are at liberty to practice as much creativity as possible.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, please don’t take it lightly since it can be quite descriptive. For instance, the hair is used to tell the personality of a character. Practice makes perfect, and you better keep doing it until you get it right. Ensure that what you draw shows the age and character of the cartoons to draw as perfectly as possible.</p>
<p>So far, our focus has been on a young character. However, that’s not always the case explaining why we will look at a cartoon painting of an old character.</p>

Start with the eyes and add their pupils, eyebrows and don’t forget to add wrinkles.</p>
<p>Since the character is old compared to the previous one, ensure that the eyebrows are thick. They should occupy more space of the forehead.</p>

So, what do you do if you want to create a female one instead? These are some of the steps to follow as you do so.</p>
<p>The procedure is not that different. However, consider that women’s facial structures are more delicate than those of their male counterparts. Some of the things that stand out include long hair, a small nose, a thin chin, thin eyebrows, and large, expressive eyelashes. Large pupils will also do, especially if you are good at drawing.</p>

<h3 id="02-Animated-Cartoons-3"><a href="#02-Animated-Cartoons-3" class="headerlink" title="02 Animated Cartoons"></a>02 Animated Cartoons</h3><p>It is important to note that these cartoons are drawn using computers despite looking as if they are hand-drawn. One thing that makes them stand out is that they seem to be in action and movement.</p>
<p>As much as that’s how they seem from the viewer’s perspective, that’s far from the truth. They are just drawn in series, and since the first one will differ from the second one, there is that illusion of movement created.</p>

<p>Just like the animated cartoons, they are showcased in series to tell or illustrate a story. The series of panels have words said by the various characters.</p>
<p>The words are usually in balloons, and a single comic strip may cover a single or double page of a newspaper.</p>

<h3 id="04-Gag-Cartoons-3"><a href="#04-Gag-Cartoons-3" class="headerlink" title="04 Gag Cartoons"></a>04 Gag Cartoons</h3><p>As the name gag suggests, these cartoons revolve around jokes. These single-paneled cartoons often make fun of human beings.</p>
<p>Through overstatements, humor resonates from what is drawn. They can either serve as entertainment or point out, if not make fun of, people, especially their mistakes and faults. Besides the cartoon, expect a caption that’s often a single sentence.</p>

Expect them to be a single drawing on an editorial page. It sheds more light on a particular newspaper’s editorial comment.</p>
<p>As much as some have captions, that’s not always the case. Just like the gag cartoons, they ridicule people, but the editorial ones focus on celebrities.</p>

So, feel encouraged because you stand a chance also to become an expert in the long run. All you need to do is take the first step. Fortunately, we are here to hold your hand as you do so. So. Without further ado, let’s get started.</p>
<h3 id="01-Cartoon-Painting-of-a-Young-Character-3"><a href="#01-Cartoon-Painting-of-a-Young-Character-3" class="headerlink" title="01 Cartoon Painting of a Young Character"></a>01 Cartoon Painting of a Young Character</h3><p><strong>These are the steps you need to follow when doing so:</strong></p>
<h5 id="Step-1Start-with-the-face-3"><a href="#Step-1Start-with-the-face-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 1Start with the face"></a>Step 1Start with the face</h5><p>The face is significant, especially when it comes to cartoon painting. It has complex as well as simple parts. For example, the face itself is pretty basic since you will need to begin with a circle.</p>
<p>After that, draw a horizontal and vertical line and ensure that they intersect in the middle.</p>

<h5 id="Step-2Draw-the-eyes-by-drawing-3"><a href="#Step-2Draw-the-eyes-by-drawing-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 2Draw the eyes by drawing"></a>Step 2Draw the eyes by drawing</h5><p>Draw the eyes by drawing an oval and ensuring that the top side is slightly tilting to the side.</p>
<p>Do the same thing on the other side since the norm is a pair of eyes. The gap between the two should also be sensible.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<h5 id="Step-3Draw-eyebrows-3"><a href="#Step-3Draw-eyebrows-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 3Draw eyebrows"></a>Step 3Draw eyebrows</h5><p>On the upper side of the eye, ensure that the lines are slightly thick. The eyebrows also need to be placed above the eyes, slightly above the thick line representing the eyelashes.</p>

<h5 id="Step-4Draw-jaw-3"><a href="#Step-4Draw-jaw-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 4Draw jaw"></a>Step 4Draw jaw</h5><p>After that, start shaping the jaw. Keep in mind that it plays a huge role in determining whether the character will look thin or fat. Additionally, how you draw the jaw determines whether the character will be old or young and how old or young the person will look.</p>

<h5 id="Step-5Draw-nose-3"><a href="#Step-5Draw-nose-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 5Draw nose"></a>Step 5Draw nose</h5><p>Design the nose and ensure that you don’t put many details. The good thing about the nose is that a tip is enough to serve the purpose. Another common approach when drawing the nose is doing so as if you are viewing it from the side.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<h5 id="Step-6Draw-mouth-3"><a href="#Step-6Draw-mouth-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 6Draw mouth"></a>Step 6Draw mouth</h5><p>Next, draw the mouth and consider the age of your character as you do so. If it is a child, despite the gender, stick to simplicity. You should also avoid drawing the lips. Preferably, go for the good, expressive trace since it never disappoints.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<h5 id="Step-7Draw-ears-3"><a href="#Step-7Draw-ears-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 7Draw ears"></a>Step 7Draw ears</h5><p>Proceed to the ears and in relation to whether the character is facing the camera or not. If your character is looking at the camera, you should see the front side view. Therefore, it won’t make sense to display the internal cavities in this case.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<h5 id="Step-8Draw-haircut-3"><a href="#Step-8Draw-haircut-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 8Draw haircut"></a>Step 8Draw haircut</h5><p>Proceed to the ears and in relation to whether the character is facing the camera or not. If your character is looking at the camera, you should see the front side view. Therefore, it won’t make sense to display the internal cavities in this case.</p>
<p>As scary as it may look, you need not be an expert to make the haircut look perfect. Additionally, there is no constant way of drawing the haircut, and you are at liberty to practice as much creativity as possible.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, please don’t take it lightly since it can be quite descriptive. For instance, the hair is used to tell the personality of a character. Practice makes perfect, and you better keep doing it until you get it right. Ensure that what you draw shows the age and character of the cartoons to draw as perfectly as possible.</p>
<p>So far, our focus has been on a young character. However, that’s not always the case explaining why we will look at a cartoon painting of an old character.</p>

Start with the eyes and add their pupils, eyebrows and don’t forget to add wrinkles.</p>
<p>Since the character is old compared to the previous one, ensure that the eyebrows are thick. They should occupy more space of the forehead.</p>

So, what do you do if you want to create a female one instead? These are some of the steps to follow as you do so.</p>
<p>The procedure is not that different. However, consider that women’s facial structures are more delicate than those of their male counterparts. Some of the things that stand out include long hair, a small nose, a thin chin, thin eyebrows, and large, expressive eyelashes. Large pupils will also do, especially if you are good at drawing.</p>

<p><strong>Storytelling:</strong></p>

<p><strong>●</strong> They add a different level of visual charisma to the storytelling process.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> With the help of a few interesting and easy-to-use apps, you can create stunning cinematic images and establish your own unique style of storytelling.</p>

                      alt="Storytelling"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Persuasive Call to Action:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> A call-to-action is a standard way of telling people what you want them to do such as making a purchase, downloading an e-book or registering for a subscription.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It helps your audience if you guide them step-by-step with the help of images.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Try out a combination of both written and animated graphics to boost your content’s persuasion.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It is easier to convince people when they have the information laid out in front of their eyes.</p>

                      alt="Persuasive Call to Action"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Simplify the Complex:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It helps if you imagine your audience like children who need a picture book to learn their lessons.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It is easier to retain information when they are visually stimulating.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Designing animated graphics is pretty easy when you understand the purpose behind it.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Scrutinize your work to check if it is causing any hindrance in keeping up with the information.</p>

<p>Marketers and content creators can take full advantage of online apps to develop amazing animated videos that would instantly grasp the viewer’s attention. Here are three secrets you should know about creating an amazing animated video:</p>
<p><strong>Storytelling:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It is easier to tell a story with moving pictures.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> They add a different level of visual charisma to the storytelling process.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> With the help of a few interesting and easy-to-use apps, you can create stunning cinematic images and establish your own unique style of storytelling.</p>

                      alt="Storytelling"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Persuasive Call to Action:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> A call-to-action is a standard way of telling people what you want them to do such as making a purchase, downloading an e-book or registering for a subscription.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It helps your audience if you guide them step-by-step with the help of images.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Try out a combination of both written and animated graphics to boost your content’s persuasion.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It is easier to convince people when they have the information laid out in front of their eyes.</p>

                      alt="Persuasive Call to Action"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Simplify the Complex:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It helps if you imagine your audience like children who need a picture book to learn their lessons.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It is easier to retain information when they are visually stimulating.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Designing animated graphics is pretty easy when you understand the purpose behind it.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Scrutinize your work to check if it is causing any hindrance in keeping up with the information.</p>

<p>Slideshows are a collection of images arranged together that an audience can quickly swipe through to view the content. Pinterest is known for its one-pin to one post feature. You cannot post more than one image or video in a pin.</p>
<p>Thus, business people could start sharing all of the images or products, services, or articles mostly because it can be stressful to do that. But with the <strong>Pinterest slideshow</strong>, you can now upload all the images you want to at once in one pin. Moreso, even have people view the pins simultaneously just by swiping through.</p>

Each image is linked to its pin page on Pinterest instead of the board or profile page if you use the Pinterest profile or board widget.</p>
<p>To install this widget, you need the user or board’s RSS feed URL, then use it as the input for a blogger slide show gadget.</p>
<p>Here are the tricky steps to follow for <strong>the Pinterest slide show</strong>;</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Constructing Pinterest RSS feed URL</strong></p>
<p>The Pinterest RSS feed URL of a user is different from aboard.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It would be the user’s profile URL + feed&#x2F;RSS for a user. To get your Profile URL, click on your username in the top right corner of your screen, and you will see a URL in your web browser’s URL. That is your profile URL.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> For the board URL, you will get that after clicking on the board from the homepage. The URL would appear on your browser’s URL bar.</p>

                      alt="Construct Pinterest Feed"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Reformatting the feed for the slideshow gadget:</strong></p>
<p>The RSS feed from step one is not very compatible with the blogger slideshow gadget. It accepts RSS feed in Media RSS format, but you can convert with Yahoo pipe. Simply plug in your feed URL in the Yahoo pipe URL.</p>
<p>You have to replace the value of the feed URL with the feed URL you got in step one and the pin count with the number of pins displayed on the slide show.</p>
<p>With this, you have successfully converted your feed URL to the media version of the Pinterest feed.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Add the slideshow widget</strong></p>
<p>Take the following step to add the slideshow widget.</p>
<p>Go to Dashboard &gt; Layout and click on ‘Add A Gadget.’</p>
<p>Now Add, A Gadget window, scroll down and select Slideshow.</p>

Pinterest allows you to display various products at a time. But first, you must also have a business account to do this.</p>
<p>When you upload multiple photos on Pinterest, they are known as carousel pins. This feature is a great advertising tool and will help you during <strong>the Pinterest slideshow</strong>.</p>
<p>This is because people would see your carousel on their home feed just like any other pin you have posted. They may also tap on the carousel and swipe through the different photos on the carousel. When the pinner saves it, they have kept the entire image.</p>
<p>Here is a step-by-step method to upload multiple photos to Pinterest.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Log into your Pinterest</strong></p>
<p>First, log into your Pinterest business account to access the feature. If you do not have a business account, it is elementary to do so. There is no need for you to enter any billing information if you are wondering about that. It is a straightforward process. Just open your account, click on the drop-down menu near your profile picture, see ‘convert to business,’ then upgrade your account, and you are good to go.</p>
<p>You should also ensure that the photos you want to upload are on your computer. If you have originally planned to use it to explain an article visually, then make sure the particular image that represents that article is correctly saved on your computer. The images should be 1:1 or 2:3 in ratio, and the format either ‘png’ or ‘jpeg.’</p>
<p>Add your pictures and upload. If you want to reorder your pin, you can replace or remove images within the carousel.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Add Title</strong></p>
<p>Add a title, description, and website of the carousel pin. Your title will be a snippet of what the blog post or article will be about or the recipe’s title. Your description should be the same as your Pinterest text, and you can also choose to let it appear only on your first image on your carousel pin.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Select a Board</strong></p>
<p>The last step is to select a board relevant to your carousel pin. Thus, you have your carousel pin and images. However, you cannot view this immediately as in a standard pin or video pin. But you can go back to your board to view your pin when it is ready.</p>

<p>Slideshows are a collection of images arranged together that an audience can quickly swipe through to view the content. Pinterest is known for its one-pin to one post feature. You cannot post more than one image or video in a pin.</p>
<p>Thus, business people could start sharing all of the images or products, services, or articles mostly because it can be stressful to do that. But with the <strong>Pinterest slideshow</strong>, you can now upload all the images you want to at once in one pin. Moreso, even have people view the pins simultaneously just by swiping through.</p>

Each image is linked to its pin page on Pinterest instead of the board or profile page if you use the Pinterest profile or board widget.</p>
<p>To install this widget, you need the user or board’s RSS feed URL, then use it as the input for a blogger slide show gadget.</p>
<p>Here are the tricky steps to follow for <strong>the Pinterest slide show</strong>;</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Constructing Pinterest RSS feed URL</strong></p>
<p>The Pinterest RSS feed URL of a user is different from aboard.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It would be the user’s profile URL + feed&#x2F;RSS for a user. To get your Profile URL, click on your username in the top right corner of your screen, and you will see a URL in your web browser’s URL. That is your profile URL.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> For the board URL, you will get that after clicking on the board from the homepage. The URL would appear on your browser’s URL bar.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2: Reformatting the feed for the slideshow gadget:</strong></p>
<p>The RSS feed from step one is not very compatible with the blogger slideshow gadget. It accepts RSS feed in Media RSS format, but you can convert with Yahoo pipe. Simply plug in your feed URL in the Yahoo pipe URL.</p>
<p>You have to replace the value of the feed URL with the feed URL you got in step one and the pin count with the number of pins displayed on the slide show.</p>
<p>With this, you have successfully converted your feed URL to the media version of the Pinterest feed.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Add the slideshow widget</strong></p>

Pinterest allows you to display various products at a time. But first, you must also have a business account to do this.</p>
<p>When you upload multiple photos on Pinterest, they are known as carousel pins. This feature is a great advertising tool and will help you during <strong>the Pinterest slideshow</strong>.</p>
<p>This is because people would see your carousel on their home feed just like any other pin you have posted. They may also tap on the carousel and swipe through the different photos on the carousel. When the pinner saves it, they have kept the entire image.</p>
<p>Here is a step-by-step method to upload multiple photos to Pinterest.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Log into your Pinterest</strong></p>
<p>First, log into your Pinterest business account to access the feature. If you do not have a business account, it is elementary to do so. There is no need for you to enter any billing information if you are wondering about that. It is a straightforward process. Just open your account, click on the drop-down menu near your profile picture, see ‘convert to business,’ then upgrade your account, and you are good to go.</p>
<p>You should also ensure that the photos you want to upload are on your computer. If you have originally planned to use it to explain an article visually, then make sure the particular image that represents that article is correctly saved on your computer. The images should be 1:1 or 2:3 in ratio, and the format either ‘png’ or ‘jpeg.’</p>
<p>Add your pictures and upload. If you want to reorder your pin, you can replace or remove images within the carousel.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="Log into your Pinterest"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Add Title</strong></p>
<p>Add a title, description, and website of the carousel pin. Your title will be a snippet of what the blog post or article will be about or the recipe’s title. Your description should be the same as your Pinterest text, and you can also choose to let it appear only on your first image on your carousel pin.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Select a Board</strong></p>
<p>The last step is to select a board relevant to your carousel pin. Thus, you have your carousel pin and images. However, you cannot view this immediately as in a standard pin or video pin. But you can go back to your board to view your pin when it is ready.</p>

<p>Slideshows are a collection of images arranged together that an audience can quickly swipe through to view the content. Pinterest is known for its one-pin to one post feature. You cannot post more than one image or video in a pin.</p>
<p>Thus, business people could start sharing all of the images or products, services, or articles mostly because it can be stressful to do that. But with the <strong>Pinterest slideshow</strong>, you can now upload all the images you want to at once in one pin. Moreso, even have people view the pins simultaneously just by swiping through.</p>

Each image is linked to its pin page on Pinterest instead of the board or profile page if you use the Pinterest profile or board widget.</p>
<p>To install this widget, you need the user or board’s RSS feed URL, then use it as the input for a blogger slide show gadget.</p>
<p>Here are the tricky steps to follow for <strong>the Pinterest slide show</strong>;</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Constructing Pinterest RSS feed URL</strong></p>
<p>The Pinterest RSS feed URL of a user is different from aboard.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It would be the user’s profile URL + feed&#x2F;RSS for a user. To get your Profile URL, click on your username in the top right corner of your screen, and you will see a URL in your web browser’s URL. That is your profile URL.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> For the board URL, you will get that after clicking on the board from the homepage. The URL would appear on your browser’s URL bar.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Construct Pinterest Feed"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Reformatting the feed for the slideshow gadget:</strong></p>
<p>The RSS feed from step one is not very compatible with the blogger slideshow gadget. It accepts RSS feed in Media RSS format, but you can convert with Yahoo pipe. Simply plug in your feed URL in the Yahoo pipe URL.</p>
<p>You have to replace the value of the feed URL with the feed URL you got in step one and the pin count with the number of pins displayed on the slide show.</p>
<p>With this, you have successfully converted your feed URL to the media version of the Pinterest feed.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Add the slideshow widget</strong></p>
<p>Take the following step to add the slideshow widget.</p>
<p>Go to Dashboard &gt; Layout and click on ‘Add A Gadget.’</p>
<p>Now Add, A Gadget window, scroll down and select Slideshow.</p>
