<p>Let me ask you a question - how much fun would it be if you could create your own animated stickers and send them to your friends and family members on Whatsapp? I mean, it would make the entire conversation more fun and also add a personal element to the entire chat. Right? Well, to tell you the truth, it is possible to create <strong>Whatsapp cartoons</strong> and stickers, and the best part is you don’t need any technical expertise to get the job done.</p>
<p>Of course, for a long time, Whatsapp didn’t allow its users to use third-party animated stickers within the messenger. But, recently the messaging platform introduced a custom “stickers pack” feature that now allows people to upload their own stickers and create a dedicated sticker app.</p>
<p>You can also rely on several third-party sticker designer applications to get the job done. So, if you have been looking for a way to use your own face as an animated sticker in Whatsapp, continue reading. In this guide, we’ll walk you through different ways to create and upload a custom cartoon sticker in Whatsapp and make your Whatsapp chats more fun.</p>

There’s no AR feature that’ll turn your face into a cartoon character. So, to use a <strong>cartoon Whatsapp profile picture</strong>, you’ll have to rely on a third-party tool to get the job done. Based on which platform you use to access Whatsapp, you can choose a wide variety of Whatsapp animated sticker creators and use them to design custom cartoon stickers to make traditional Whatsapp conversations more fun.</p>
<p>One of the easiest ways to create custom stickers for Whatsapp is to use Wondershare <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>.

Claymators mold them into their desired characters using painstaking efforts, patience and team work. First, a miniature skeleton is made to fit the clay around. On top of that goes a latex layer. Then the Claymation artist moves the models into required position following the storyline or script. <strong>Clay animation</strong> not only uses clay, sometimes it involves wires and armatures for smoother movement of the characters.

In stop motion animation, animators typically shoot at fps or fps.

Here is a list of some of the most memorable Claymation flicks.</p>

<p>The British stop-motion comedy franchise which had 5 installation had been a first of its kind. The characters Wallace and Gromit later inspired their own movie “Wallace and Gromit – The Curse of the Were-Rabbit” which was released back in 20by Dreamworks Animation. The mystery solving duo ran a pest control company while Wallace experiments on a brain washing gadget for dissuading wild rabbits which leads to its own disaster. This movie has a classic appeal amongst children an adults alike.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Directed by Time Burton, this film is one that impresses us all every time. The success of this Claymation is embedded in the fact that it made creepy gothic characters look appealing. It has a mixture of both the Halloween and Christmas theme. The character Jack Skellington goes through a magic door to arrive at ‘Christmas Town’. Using Claymation was an excellent choice for the script as it enabled the animators to bring about that distorted movements that evolved into a gorgeous visual storytelling.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Popular claymation give credit to Chicken Run for its amazing dramatization of fiction. For the first time ever a stop motion film had a cast as amazing as Chicken Run; starring Mel Gibson and Timothy Spall. The film was a collaboration amongst elite production studios like Aardman Animations and DreamWorks Animation. The story is a spoof of the 19film ‘The Great Escape’.</p>

                ></p>
<p>The Corpse Bride is probably the second Tim Burton film on our list. The director seems to have a special preference for the stop motion genre. When you combine that with an amazing musical script and charming but relatable ghoulish characters, the flick becomes an absolute delight.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Here’s where Tim Burton establishes his cult following. The film Caroline was based the novel by Neil Gaiman. The story is about the weird adventures of a girl named ‘Caroline’ and a button eyed rag doll who she meets after travelling through a portal. Laika Studios made the appeal of the film as beautiful yet unsettling. It harbors plenty of dark and creepy aspects like by many followers of this type of fiction.</p>

                ></p>
<p>There are dozen animated films that were way ahead of their time and were discontinued as the medium was seen more to be specifically directed for children only. Tim Burton’s creation ‘Frankenweenie’ was considered a ‘love letter’ to the Golden Age of Horror films. It was considered too dark for the average viewer so the director was later let go by Disney.</p>

                ></p>
<p>A more somber attempt at stop motion films was Paranorman. It featured printed faces in the characters which needed a new and innovative creative approach. People experienced ground breaking characterization of an openly gay character in the film which was a milestone in terms of mainstream animated films. Films like ‘Paranorman’ perfectly depicts the entry of modern film making software like ****<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>** and Maya in stop motion animations.</p>

<p>From the makers of Paranorman, Boxtrolls all introduces an innovative approach to using clay models in films. Featuring Ben Kingsley, Simon Peggs and Richard Ayoade, Boxtrolls is probably the very few box office hits on this list. The film first premiered at the Venice Film Festival the same year of its release.</p>

Claymators mold them into their desired characters using painstaking efforts, patience and team work. First, a miniature skeleton is made to fit the clay around. On top of that goes a latex layer. Then the Claymation artist moves the models into required position following the storyline or script. <strong>Clay animation</strong> not only uses clay, sometimes it involves wires and armatures for smoother movement of the characters. Moreover, artists have to be concerned about fingerprints and dirt marks all the time. At times, plastic made or fabric made accessories is brought into play to give the figurines a realistic look.

Claymators mold them into their desired characters using painstaking efforts, patience and team work. First, a miniature skeleton is made to fit the clay around. On top of that goes a latex layer. Then the Claymation artist moves the models into required position following the storyline or script. <strong>Clay animation</strong> not only uses clay, sometimes it involves wires and armatures for smoother movement of the characters. Moreover, artists have to be concerned about fingerprints and dirt marks all the time. At times, plastic made or fabric made accessories is brought into play to give the figurines a realistic look. Detailing is the most difficult and important part for enhancing your clay character and film.</p>
<p><strong>Clay animation</strong> also uses stop- motion animation. It includes capturing minute movements and of models to make it look like the characters is acting on their own. In stop motion animation, animators typically shoot at fps or fps. Though some claymators prefer to capture it at half the rate, fps or fps whereas fps is frame per second these captured still images are edited then converted into a video or film using stop motion software.</p>

Wallace is the star of the franchise featuring Wallace and Gromit. The idea of this dynamic duo took about seven years to turn into a full scale television show. It went to becoming an Oscar winning work of art.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Victor Van Dort (Corpse Bride):</strong> The persona of a handsome man in his prime. Short and messy brown vest over a slim structure with big brown eyes. The protagonist of the corpse bride, Victor is a character in conflict stuck within an epic love triangle involving the dead. This amazing dark satire brings out the best in clay animation with precise movements and amazing music.</p>

The plot is about chickens attempting to escape their inevitable demise. Rocky crash lands in the coop pretending to have figured out how to fly.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Coraline:</strong> Not your everyday story about an eleven year old. Coraline Jones continues to haunt&#x2F;impact us all even today and has a strong cult backing. It was initially meant to be live action but was later shifted to Claymation which took over four years to make.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Shaun the Sheep:</strong> Shaun is a sheep (obviously) who goes on world adventures. The movies was featured as the TV spin off.

                ></p>
<p>Directed by Time Burton, this film is one that impresses us all every time. The success of this Claymation is embedded in the fact that it made creepy gothic characters look appealing. It has a mixture of both the Halloween and Christmas theme. The character Jack Skellington goes through a magic door to arrive at ‘Christmas Town’. Using Claymation was an excellent choice for the script as it enabled the animators to bring about that distorted movements that evolved into a gorgeous visual storytelling.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Popular claymation give credit to Chicken Run for its amazing dramatization of fiction. For the first time ever a stop motion film had a cast as amazing as Chicken Run; starring Mel Gibson and Timothy Spall. The film was a collaboration amongst elite production studios like Aardman Animations and DreamWorks Animation. The story is a spoof of the 19film ‘The Great Escape’.</p>

                ></p>
<p>The Corpse Bride is probably the second Tim Burton film on our list. The director seems to have a special preference for the stop motion genre. When you combine that with an amazing musical script and charming but relatable ghoulish characters, the flick becomes an absolute delight.</p>
<h3 id="05Coraline-2009-3"><a href="#05Coraline-2009-3" class="headerlink" title="05Coraline (2009)"></a>05Coraline (2009)</h3><p><img

                      alt="coraline"
                ></p>
<p>Here’s where Tim Burton establishes his cult following. The film Caroline was based the novel by Neil Gaiman. The story is about the weird adventures of a girl named ‘Caroline’ and a button eyed rag doll who she meets after travelling through a portal. Laika Studios made the appeal of the film as beautiful yet unsettling. It harbors plenty of dark and creepy aspects like by many followers of this type of fiction.</p>

                ></p>
<p>There are dozen animated films that were way ahead of their time and were discontinued as the medium was seen more to be specifically directed for children only. Tim Burton’s creation ‘Frankenweenie’ was considered a ‘love letter’ to the Golden Age of Horror films. It was considered too dark for the average viewer so the director was later let go by Disney.</p>

                ></p>
<p>A more somber attempt at stop motion films was Paranorman. It featured printed faces in the characters which needed a new and innovative creative approach. People experienced ground breaking characterization of an openly gay character in the film which was a milestone in terms of mainstream animated films. Films like ‘Paranorman’ perfectly depicts the entry of modern film making software like ****<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>** and Maya in stop motion animations.</p>

<p>From the makers of Paranorman, Boxtrolls all introduces an innovative approach to using clay models in films.

<p>When you are trying to make an <strong>aesthetic drawings cartoon</strong>, the primary thing to focus on is the composition. Composition is the combination, arrangement, and organization of objects within the borders of drawing space. To have a great aesthetic cartoon drawing, you must focus on bringing the eyes of the viewer toward your center of interest within an aesthetically-pleasing composition.

<p>As the popularity of animated video games is reaching new heights, demand for game animators are also going up. But, the Information regarding how to <strong>animate games</strong> is less or not sufficient enough.</p>
<h4 id="In-this-article-20"><a href="#In-this-article-20" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 [What is 2D &amp; 3D Animation Game?](#Part 1)</p>
<p>02 [How Do You Animate Games?](#Part 2)</p>
<p>03 [How to Draw 2d &amp; 3d Characters for Video Games?](#Part 3)</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-2D-3D-Animation-Game"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-2D-3D-Animation-Game" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is 2D &amp; 3D Animation Game?"></a>Part 1 What is 2D &amp; 3D Animation Game?</h2><p>Gaming animation is a blend of art and technology. It is one of those fields that require several technical skills. These are brilliant programming skills, understanding the basics of computer science, and practical technology know-how, collectively standing as the basic fundamental of Animation. Both 2D and 3D Animation changed the gaming experience forever and created an array of opportunities. But they differ in working and application.</p>
<h3 id="01Working-on-2D-Animation"><a href="#01Working-on-2D-Animation" class="headerlink" title="01Working on 2D Animation"></a>01Working on 2D Animation</h3><p>Flipbook can be a good example of the mechanism behind 2D Animation. After drawing a character or an object on the first page of a notebook, continue drawing for the next page and so on. Each removing should be a bit ahead or behind. When flipped swiftly, the series of drawings makes the character or object move.</p>
<p>The working of 2D Animation is not so different. But the detailing of the subject or the object cannot be minimal as a flipbook. 2D Animation demands more characters and more details while at the same time requiring smooth, visually appealing, and accurate detailing, which is a lot of pressure for the makers. Thanks to 2D making software, a week’s work can be taken care of in minutes or two.</p>
<h3 id="02Working-on-3D-Animation"><a href="#02Working-on-3D-Animation" class="headerlink" title="02Working on 3D Animation"></a>02Working on 3D Animation</h3><p>The working mechanism of 3D Animation is more complicated than 2D. It is a layered process that requires several skills. It also involves “rigged” and animated 3D models. In 3D, the initial sketch of the entire subject and object is the first step towards the animation procedure. The second step is to make a 3D model of the intended animated object. It was third, texturing of the 3D animated object. Rigging is the final step; it gives the 3D model the power and ability to move. Once rigging is done, the character is already for posing. Drop it to the scene and start your Animation.</p>

It is one of those fields that require several technical skills. These are brilliant programming skills, understanding the basics of computer science, and practical technology know-how, collectively standing as the basic fundamental of Animation. Both 2D and 3D Animation changed the gaming experience forever and created an array of opportunities. But they differ in working and application.</p>
<h3 id="01Working-on-2D-Animation-3"><a href="#01Working-on-2D-Animation-3" class="headerlink" title="01Working on 2D Animation"></a>01Working on 2D Animation</h3><p>Flipbook can be a good example of the mechanism behind 2D Animation. After drawing a character or an object on the first page of a notebook, continue drawing for the next page and so on. Each removing should be a bit ahead or behind. When flipped swiftly, the series of drawings makes the character or object move.</p>
<p>The working of 2D Animation is not so different. But the detailing of the subject or the object cannot be minimal as a flipbook. 2D Animation demands more characters and more details while at the same time requiring smooth, visually appealing, and accurate detailing, which is a lot of pressure for the makers. Thanks to 2D making software, a week’s work can be taken care of in minutes or two.</p>
<h3 id="02Working-on-3D-Animation-3"><a href="#02Working-on-3D-Animation-3" class="headerlink" title="02Working on 3D Animation"></a>02Working on 3D Animation</h3><p>The working mechanism of 3D Animation is more complicated than 2D. It is a layered process that requires several skills. It also involves “rigged” and animated 3D models. In 3D, the initial sketch of the entire subject and object is the first step towards the animation procedure. The second step is to make a 3D model of the intended animated object. It was third, texturing of the 3D animated object. Rigging is the final step; it gives the 3D model the power and ability to move. Once rigging is done, the character is already for posing. Drop it to the scene and start your Animation.</p>

<h3 id="For-Win-3"><a href="#For-Win-3" class="headerlink" title="For Win"></a>For Win</h3><h4 id="Step-1：-Adding-Image-to-Video-Track-3"><a href="#Step-1：-Adding-Image-to-Video-Track-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 1： Adding Image to Video Track"></a>Step 1： Adding Image to Video Track</h4><p>With Filmora, adding images to video is a matter of seconds! Start by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify the position where you want to add the image and place the Playhead there.</li>
<li>Right-click on the picture from the media library. Click on the “Insert” option. Your image will be added. Select the “Append” option, if you want to add an image at the video end.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-to-animate-pictures-in-canva-3.JPG"
                      alt="Adding Image to Video Track"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note: How to Remove Black Bars around the Image?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Go to “Settings” from the File section.</li>
<li>Click on the “Editing” tab and select “Photo Placement.”</li>
<li>Choose from the “Crop to Fit” or “Pan To Zoom” option. The black bars will be removed.</li>
</ul>
<p>To add the image in between the video clip, split them. Now, add the image between the split parts.</p>
<h4 id="Step-2：-Add-Images-as-Overlays-3"><a href="#Step-2：-Add-Images-as-Overlays-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 2： Add Images as Overlays"></a>Step 2： Add Images as Overlays</h4><p>To add images as overlays, drag the image to a video track above the main track. The main track consists of your video.</p>
<p>Track 1 (or the track with a video clip) is the base of your video. If you add anything else, it will be displayed above this track as video track 2, 3, and so on. Overall, you can add 100 video tracks.</p>
<h4 id="Step-3：-Edit-Your-Image-3"><a href="#Step-3：-Edit-Your-Image-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 3： Edit Your Image"></a>Step 3： Edit Your Image</h4><p>If you know how to animate an image in Canva, editing images on Filmora is even easier. You can try the following methods:</p>
<p><strong>Animate Your Images</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To add animation presets to the image, click on the image twice.</li>
<li>Go to the “Animation Tab” and look for an animation preset.</li>
<li>Drag the presets to the image for its effect</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-to-animate-pictures-in-canva-4.JPG"
                      alt="Animate Your Images"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Make Image Color Adjustments</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Double-click on the image</li>
<li>Go to the “Color” tab and then the “Color” section</li>
<li>Customize the temperature, saturation, brightness, etc., as per your need.</li>
<li>Press Ok.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Change Image Duration</strong></p>
<p>You can increase the image duration to more than the default timing of 5 seconds. For that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the image and select the “Duration” option.</li>
<li>Go to the “Duration Setting” panel.</li>
<li>Add the new duration timing.</li>
</ul>
<p><img

                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-to-animate-pictures-in-canva-5.JPG"
                      alt="Change Image Duration"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Adjust Position, Rotate&#x2F;Flip, and Opacity</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You can resize the image position through the circles and squares at the image edges.</li>
<li>To flip or rotate the image, double-click on the picture. From the “Image Panel,” go to “Transform” and then click on “Rotate.” You can choose either “Horizontal Flip” or “Vertical Flip” to flip the images.</li>
<li>Double-click on the image and click on the “Composting” option to add opacity. You can choose the blending mode or adjust the “Opacity” accordingly.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-to-animate-pictures-in-canva-6.JPG" alt="Adjust Position Rotate/Flip and Opacity"></p>
<h3 id="For-Mac-3"><a href="#For-Mac-3" class="headerlink" title="For Mac"></a>For Mac</h3><p>Filmora for Mac comes with a drag and drop feature to add transitions, animated titles, and effects. You can start a new project from scratch by clicking on “New Project”. The entire process is the same as that for Windows users.</p>
<p>To apply animation in the images, use the motion effects option. For that,</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the Image</li>
<li>Go to Motion Tab</li>
<li>Select a motion effect</li>
<li>Double-click to apply the effect</li>
</ul>
