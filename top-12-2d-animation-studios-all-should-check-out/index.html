In layman’s terms, a 2D animation is a video where the movements are represented in two-dimensional space. The subjects in the video can either move forward or backward, but they can’t be allowed to move in a third dimension (depth).</p>
<p>Now, even though there are tools you can use to edit a 2D animation on your own, the process is time-consuming and requires certain expertise. And, since the primary objective of creating a 2D animation video is to engage potential customers, it’s always necessary to be super creative with the editing approach. This is the reason why the majority of brands hire professional 2D animation studios for the job.</p>
<p>The cost to create a 2D animation video can range anywhere between $1,000 to $10,000. It all depends on the length of the video, the production company you hire, and the quality you are looking for. But, it’s also worth noting that high pricing does not always mean superior quality as well. You’ll have to be extra cautious while picking through the <strong>best 2D animation studios</strong>.</p>

Well, the answer is - it depends. If you have hired a team of professional editors or a dedicated <strong>2D animation company</strong>, you’ll get your animated video within a week. However, if you try to follow the DIY approach and don’t know where to get started, it can even take up to 3-4 weeks for the video to complete.</p>

In layman’s terms, a 2D animation is a video where the movements are represented in two-dimensional space. The subjects in the video can either move forward or backward, but they can’t be allowed to move in a third dimension (depth).</p>
<p>Now, even though there are tools you can use to edit a 2D animation on your own, the process is time-consuming and requires certain expertise. And, since the primary objective of creating a 2D animation video is to engage potential customers, it’s always necessary to be super creative with the editing approach. This is the reason why the majority of brands hire professional 2D animation studios for the job.</p>
<p>The cost to create a 2D animation video can range anywhere between $1,000 to $10,000. It all depends on the length of the video, the production company you hire, and the quality you are looking for. But, it’s also worth noting that high pricing does not always mean superior quality as well. You’ll have to be extra cautious while picking through the <strong>best 2D animation studios</strong>.</p>

Well, the answer is - it depends. If you have hired a team of professional editors or a dedicated <strong>2D animation company</strong>, you’ll get your animated video within a week. However, if you try to follow the DIY approach and don’t know where to get started, it can even take up to 3-4 weeks for the video to complete.</p>

<p>Yes, it is definitely possible In fact, it couldn’t be easier. A lot of the ‘whiteboard animation’ generators also work as <strong>blackboard animation</strong> generators.</p>
<p>In this guide, we hope to shed some light on the subject so that everyone can have an easier time approaching the matter of creating a blackboard project on their own.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-Is-Blackboard-Animation-Outdated"><a href="#Part-1-Is-Blackboard-Animation-Outdated" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Is Blackboard Animation Outdated?"></a>Part 1 <strong>Is Blackboard Animation Outdated?</strong></h2><p><strong>Blackboard animation</strong> some may say is as outdated as the concept of ‘blackboards’ themselves. After all, nowadays, whiteboards are the standard for presenting information in a school setting — with many preferring the ease of using dry-erase markers over the more unwieldy chalk.</p>
<p>However, unlike the inconveniences of using an actual chalkboard, <strong>chalkboard animation</strong> is not so different from whiteboard animation In fact, it’s just given a different look. One that may be exactly what you’re looking for — especially if you’re looking to get in touch with the older generation (who would no doubt be more familiar with the concept.)</p>

Well, that’s easy really. You’ll need images Or, rather, you’ll need visuals outside of just the plain text that is usually associated with <strong>chalkboard animation</strong>.</p>
<p>With the right kind of visuals to go along with your informational text, you can boost the effectiveness of your <strong>chalkboard animation video</strong> and make it more palatable. Perfectly in line with the modern needs of the era.</p>

We’ve also decided to choose a more ‘custom’ method, rather than using one of the premium <strong>blackboard animation</strong> generators (which usually require you to pay a steep price in order to gain access to a media library.)</p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Pick-Your-Software"><a href="#01Step-1-Pick-Your-Software" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1. Pick Your Software"></a>01Step 1. Pick Your Software</h3><p>The first step in creating <strong>chalkboard animation</strong> is to pick the software that you want to use This can be something more ‘animation-specific’, like After Effects. Or something more ‘video-editing-specific’ like Filmora.</p>
<p>Again, because this is meant to be more of a ‘general’ tutorial, we won’t be showing you exactly how to use whatever editing software you decide to use in order to create your <strong>blackboard animation</strong> videos. But, as a general kind of advice, it would be best that you pick a video editor like <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> that offers a Timeline feature that will allow you to quickly put together a project</p>

Create a Storyboard</strong></h3><p>Next, to make the actual <strong>blackboard animation</strong> creation process go smoother, it’s important that you create a storyboard that will outline the video that you want to create</p>
<p>The more detailed this storyboard is, the better Although, of course, you don’t necessarily have to draw every single frame of your <strong>chalkboard animation</strong> beforehand. Just sketch out the general idea. It will help make sure that you won’t have to rush about making all sorts of corrections in the future</p>

Draw Characters</strong></h3><p>For this step, we say ‘characters’ and use the word ‘draw.’ But really, this is a very open kind of step where we encourage you to put together all media that you will need to make your project into a reality This is where the storyboard really helps. After all, with that, you have an idea of exactly what kind of characters, settings, music, audio, etc. you’ll need for each scene (if not each frame)</p>
<p>If you’re not the ‘drawing’ type, by the way, there are both FREE and premium media libraries that you can take advantage of to use for your project It might be difficult to find matching art styles at first. But, if you’re really particular about that, then you can always find a freelance digital artist to design with a specific style in mind</p>

<p>Yes, it is definitely possible In fact, it couldn’t be easier. A lot of the ‘whiteboard animation’ generators also work as <strong>blackboard animation</strong> generators.</p>

After all, nowadays, whiteboards are the standard for presenting information in a school setting — with many preferring the ease of using dry-erase markers over the more unwieldy chalk.</p>
<p>However, unlike the inconveniences of using an actual chalkboard, <strong>chalkboard animation</strong> is not so different from whiteboard animation In fact, it’s just given a different look. One that may be exactly what you’re looking for — especially if you’re looking to get in touch with the older generation (who would no doubt be more familiar with the concept.)</p>

Well, that’s easy really. You’ll need images Or, rather, you’ll need visuals outside of just the plain text that is usually associated with <strong>chalkboard animation</strong>.</p>
<p>With the right kind of visuals to go along with your informational text, you can boost the effectiveness of your <strong>chalkboard animation video</strong> and make it more palatable. Perfectly in line with the modern needs of the era.</p>

Or something more ‘video-editing-specific’ like Filmora.</p>
<p>Again, because this is meant to be more of a ‘general’ tutorial, we won’t be showing you exactly how to use whatever editing software you decide to use in order to create your <strong>blackboard animation</strong> videos. But, as a general kind of advice, it would be best that you pick a video editor like <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> that offers a Timeline feature that will allow you to quickly put together a project</p>

<p>The more detailed this storyboard is, the better Although, of course, you don’t necessarily have to draw every single frame of your <strong>chalkboard animation</strong> beforehand.

<p>If you’re not the ‘drawing’ type, by the way, there are both FREE and premium media libraries that you can take advantage of to use for your project It might be difficult to find matching art styles at first.

Well, that’s easy really. You’ll need images Or, rather, you’ll need visuals outside of just the plain text that is usually associated with <strong>chalkboard animation</strong>.</p>
<p>With the right kind of visuals to go along with your informational text, you can boost the effectiveness of your <strong>chalkboard animation video</strong> and make it more palatable. Perfectly in line with the modern needs of the era.</p>

We’ve also decided to choose a more ‘custom’ method, rather than using one of the premium <strong>blackboard animation</strong> generators (which usually require you to pay a steep price in order to gain access to a media library.)</p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Pick-Your-Software-3"><a href="#01Step-1-Pick-Your-Software-3" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1. Pick Your Software"></a>01Step 1. Pick Your Software</h3><p>The first step in creating <strong>chalkboard animation</strong> is to pick the software that you want to use This can be something more ‘animation-specific’, like After Effects. Or something more ‘video-editing-specific’ like Filmora.</p>
<p>Again, because this is meant to be more of a ‘general’ tutorial, we won’t be showing you exactly how to use whatever editing software you decide to use in order to create your <strong>blackboard animation</strong> videos. But, as a general kind of advice, it would be best that you pick a video editor like <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> that offers a Timeline feature that will allow you to quickly put together a project</p>

<h3 id="02Step-2-Create-a-Storyboard-3"><a href="#02Step-2-Create-a-Storyboard-3" class="headerlink" title="02Step 2. Create a Storyboard"></a>02<strong>Step 2. Create a Storyboard</strong></h3><p>Next, to make the actual <strong>blackboard animation</strong> creation process go smoother, it’s important that you create a storyboard that will outline the video that you want to create</p>
<p>The more detailed this storyboard is, the better Although, of course, you don’t necessarily have to draw every single frame of your <strong>chalkboard animation</strong> beforehand. Just sketch out the general idea. It will help make sure that you won’t have to rush about making all sorts of corrections in the future</p>

<h3 id="03Step-3-Draw-Characters-3"><a href="#03Step-3-Draw-Characters-3" class="headerlink" title="03Step 3. Draw Characters"></a>03<strong>Step 3. Draw Characters</strong></h3><p>For this step, we say ‘characters’ and use the word ‘draw.’ But really, this is a very open kind of step where we encourage you to put together all media that you will need to make your project into a reality This is where the storyboard really helps. After all, with that, you have an idea of exactly what kind of characters, settings, music, audio, etc. you’ll need for each scene (if not each frame)</p>
<p>If you’re not the ‘drawing’ type, by the way, there are both FREE and premium media libraries that you can take advantage of to use for your project It might be difficult to find matching art styles at first. But, if you’re really particular about that, then you can always find a freelance digital artist to design with a specific style in mind</p>

Put Together Project</strong></h3><p>Last of all, of course, is the process of putting everything together. Do you have your software? Great Launch it and create a new project Do you have your storyboard? That’s also great Now you have an idea where each character and setting will go</p>
<p>In the image below, we’re only showing the start of a potential project. We’ve only added one image to the timeline But, as you can see, with the use of Filmora, even this one image can be turned into a video</p>

Whether you’re doing it to promote your services&#x2F;goods or just genuinely looking to impart knowledge to another</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Some may think that blackboards are outdated — for the mere fact that blackboards themselves are considered outdated when compared to whiteboards — but that doesn’t make them any less effective at getting a message across so long as you include the right kind of visuals</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> In our brief ‘overview’ tutorial, we expand on the subject of <strong>blackboard animation</strong> some more. Be warned, it’s not the kind of project you should go into if you’re not prepared for the work Longer projects, especially, will require quite a bit of elbow grease to get done.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Still, there’s something satisfying about a well-done <strong>chalkboard animation video</strong> that will not only be a joy to create but also, hopefully, catch the attention of your audience as well.</p>

<p>So, let’s move ahead as this content will show you different <strong>cartoon drawing styles</strong>, and in no time, you’ll master the art.</p>

Below are a few cartoon drawing styles you may want to use for your next project.</p>
<h3 id="01Modern-Cartoon-Style"><a href="#01Modern-Cartoon-Style" class="headerlink" title="01Modern Cartoon Style"></a>01Modern Cartoon Style</h3><p>This style is currently the most common art style displayed on TV channels like Cartoon Network.</p>
<p>Note that this <strong>cartoon-style drawing’s</strong> main features are the thick outlines, geometric shapes, and bright colors.</p>
<p>One of the significant reasons this drawing style is this way is that using simple shapes without much detail makes the overall animation process much faster and saves resources for the studios. Nonetheless, it is a beautiful and captivating <strong>cartoon drawing style</strong>!</p>
<p>This drawing style is used by many modern cartoons. Here are a few examples:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The Powerpuff Girls</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Dexter’s Laboratory</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Codename: Kids Next Door</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Gravity Falls</p>
<h3 id="02Realistic-Cartoon-Style"><a href="#02Realistic-Cartoon-Style" class="headerlink" title="02Realistic Cartoon Style"></a>02Realistic Cartoon Style</h3><p>This <strong>cartoon drawing style</strong> is more quirky since, generally, cartoon drawing is more likely to simplify shapes. The realistic <strong>cartoon-style drawing</strong> adds more details and keeps figures much more in line with reality. This drawing style is typical among artists who vectorize people’s photographs.</p>
<p>You can also, to some extent, include Caricatures in this category. Caricatures are generally very realistic besides the whole enlargement and shrinking of specific body parts!</p>
<p>Few examples of realistic cartoon drawing styles:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Ugly Americans</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> General Caricataures</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> My Hero Academia</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Sword Art Online</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Attack on Titan</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood</p>
<h3 id="04Classic-Manga"><a href="#04Classic-Manga" class="headerlink" title="04Classic Manga"></a>04Classic Manga</h3><p>The old Japanese manga characters tend to possess human-like attributes (proportions) in terms of the body. The difference is the big eyes they have the most time.</p>
<p>Generally, this <strong>cartoon drawing style</strong> focuses more on feminine bodies, possessing angular chins and thin bodies. Some drawing styles tend to make some parts of the body overtly long compared to the rest of the body; for instance, the legs are mostly longer than other parts.</p>
<p>A few examples of classic manga possessing this <strong>cartoon style drawing</strong> are:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Oh My Goddess</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Urusei Yatsura</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Sailor Moon</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Hellsing</p>
<h3 id="05Chibi-Drawing-Style"><a href="#05Chibi-Drawing-Style" class="headerlink" title="05Chibi Drawing Style"></a>05Chibi Drawing Style</h3><p>The Chibi <strong>Cartoon Drawing Style</strong> mainly focuses on making the characters into a tiny version of themselves as if being compressed or compacted into a small container.</p>
<p>Examples of where this drawing style is used:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Lucky Star</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Bottle Fairy</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Himouto! Umaru-chan</p>

Though this style has undergone some evolution throughout the years, the main features remained constant! That is to say, the yellow bodies and big and white sphere-like eyes remained.</p>
<h3 id="07Classic-Disney"><a href="#07Classic-Disney" class="headerlink" title="07Classic Disney"></a>07Classic Disney</h3><p>This drawing style was a staple for years, though this drawing style has had an evolutionary cartoon drawing style over the years.</p>
<h3 id="08Mid-20th-Century-Disney"><a href="#08Mid-20th-Century-Disney" class="headerlink" title="08Mid 20th Century Disney"></a>08Mid 20th Century Disney</h3><p>Disney upped their game during the mid 20th century and started working more with live actors, drawing from references, and filming shots before drawing the cartoons.</p>
<p>Some remarkable examples of this <strong>cartoon drawing style</strong> are</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Alice in Wonderland</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Cinderella</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Beauty and the Beast</p>
<h3 id="09Modern-Disney-Drawing-Style"><a href="#09Modern-Disney-Drawing-Style" class="headerlink" title="09Modern Disney Drawing Style"></a>09Modern Disney Drawing Style</h3><p>This <strong>cartoon-style drawing</strong> is an immediate improvement of the mid-20th 20th drawing style. This cartoon style is brighter, more detailed, and more complex generally.</p>
<p>Although Disney has stopped creating 2D cartoon drawings, there are still some examples of this more refined art style:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The Princess and the Frog</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Lilo and Stitch</p>
<h3 id="10Old-Cartoon-Drawing-Style"><a href="#10Old-Cartoon-Drawing-Style" class="headerlink" title="10Old Cartoon Drawing Style"></a>10Old Cartoon Drawing Style</h3><p>This drawing style is mostly in black and white format, with very high contrast body parts.

Sometimes, this type of drawing is referred to as Noodle drawing because the character’s body moves as if there are no bones in their body.</p>
<p>Some examples of this <strong>cartoon drawing</strong> <strong>style</strong> include:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Mickey Mouse</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Betty Boop</p>
<h3 id="11South-Park"><a href="#11South-Park" class="headerlink" title="11South Park"></a>11South Park</h3><p>South Park <strong>cartoon drawing style</strong> is aptly geometric and has little depth. Shadows or highlights in this cartoon-style are rare. The colors are pretty solid and clean.</p>
<h3 id="12Chrono-Trigger-Dragon-Ball-Akira-Toriyama"><a href="#12Chrono-Trigger-Dragon-Ball-Akira-Toriyama" class="headerlink" title="12Chrono Trigger&#x2F; Dragon Ball (Akira Toriyama)"></a>12Chrono Trigger&#x2F; Dragon Ball (Akira Toriyama)</h3><p>Akira Toriyama’s <strong>cartoon drawing style</strong> characterizes having big and almost rectangular eyes and a lot of geometric shapes and definitions in the muscles.</p>

<p>The lines generally are thin, and the eyes are prominent in black and white colors.</p>
<h3 id="14Betty-Boop"><a href="#14Betty-Boop" class="headerlink" title="14Betty Boop"></a>14Betty Boop</h3><p> Betty Boop’s <strong>cartoon drawing style</strong> possesses contrasting black and white colors. Fragile lines with the characters contain a very high amount of black shapes.</p>
<h3 id="15Adventure-Time"><a href="#15Adventure-Time" class="headerlink" title="15Adventure Time"></a>15Adventure Time</h3><p>Adventure Time’s art is incredibly geometric, and its characters are nearly boneless, making it a more current example of a cartoon drawing style.</p>
<p>More fluid animation is possible as a result of this. The art is also quite brilliant, with vibrant hues that leap off the screen.</p>
<p>Aside from that, the characters’ eyes are usually tiny (with a few exceptions), and the lines are skinny.</p>

When the lyrics of a song appear on the screen in an animated version all through the song’s duration, it is usually said to be an animated lyric video.</p>
<p>Such videos are different from any normal music videos. Adding some flash and loops to the texts of the songs can enhance a plain lyric video.</p>
<p>For instance, there are times when you are unable to understand the lyrics of a song or maybe you wish to sing in a different language and are unable to understand the lyrics or the words, at such times the animated lyric video makes it easy for your understanding.</p>

When the lyrics of a song appear on the screen in an animated version all through the song’s duration, it is usually said to be an animated lyric video.</p>
<p>Such videos are different from any normal music videos. Adding some flash and loops to the texts of the songs can enhance a plain lyric video.</p>
<p>For instance, there are times when you are unable to understand the lyrics of a song or maybe you wish to sing in a different language and are unable to understand the lyrics or the words, at such times the animated lyric video makes it easy for your understanding.</p>

When the lyrics of a song appear on the screen in an animated version all through the song’s duration, it is usually said to be an animated lyric video.</p>
<p>Such videos are different from any normal music videos. Adding some flash and loops to the texts of the songs can enhance a plain lyric video.</p>
<p>For instance, there are times when you are unable to understand the lyrics of a song or maybe you wish to sing in a different language and are unable to understand the lyrics or the words, at such times the animated lyric video makes it easy for your understanding.</p>

Animation with Adobe is one of the most convenient ways of animation. Here is how you can convert any 2D image to a 3D animated image using adobe. For those of you who are used to animating with adobe, it must be simple to follow the few steps listed below:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Firstly, you need to convert the 2D layers of the still image to 3D postcards (planes that possess 3D properties). In case the layer you are starting with is a text layer, any transparency will be retained.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Now to convert the object into 3D, wrap the 2D layer around any 3D object such as cube, cone, or sphere. Choose the shape that suits your layer.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Next, you need to create a 3D mesh from greyscale information in a 2D image.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Now you need to simulate a metalworking technique called “Repousse”. By doing so, you will be extruding a 2D object in a 3D space</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Next, you need to build a 3D volume from any multi-frame file like DICOM. Photoshop automatically converts the individual slices of the file into a 3D object that can be manipulated in 3D space from any angle. Furthermore, if you wish to optimize the display, you can also apply any 3D volume render effects.</p>

Animation with Adobe is one of the most convenient ways of animation. Here is how you can convert any 2D image to a 3D animated image using adobe. For those of you who are used to animating with adobe, it must be simple to follow the few steps listed below:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Firstly, you need to convert the 2D layers of the still image to 3D postcards (planes that possess 3D properties). In case the layer you are starting with is a text layer, any transparency will be retained.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Now to convert the object into 3D, wrap the 2D layer around any 3D object such as cube, cone, or sphere. Choose the shape that suits your layer.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Next, you need to create a 3D mesh from greyscale information in a 2D image.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Now you need to simulate a metalworking technique called “Repousse”. By doing so, you will be extruding a 2D object in a 3D space</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Next, you need to build a 3D volume from any multi-frame file like DICOM. Photoshop automatically converts the individual slices of the file into a 3D object that can be manipulated in 3D space from any angle. Furthermore, if you wish to optimize the display, you can also apply any 3D volume render effects.</p>

                      alt="Upload Photo to Turn into GIF"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Choose animation Style</strong></p>
<p>Next, choose how you want the uploaded photo to be animated Loading.IO offers a couple of animations that you can choose from Including the ‘beat’ animation, which is what we choose for our example</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Adjust Settings</strong></p>
<p>This step is technically optional, as there are default settings already prepared if you have no other specifications for your image-turned GIF. But, if you want, you can adjust certain settings for a better outcome</p>
<p>For example, you can speed up the animation with the ‘Speed’ slider. Or, you can increase the number of times the GIF loops by adjusting the ‘Repeat’ slider. Test out a couple of settings to get the best result</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

But, it is a very professional method of creating an animated GIF — one that will allow you to control every step of the process (which may be exactly what you want)</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: Import Images into an Image Stack</strong></p>
<p>First, starting on a new product, upload the images that you want to turn into a GIF into a photoshop ‘Image Stack’. This can be done by clicking the ‘File’ tab and selecting the ‘Scripts &gt; Load Files into Stack…’ option</p>
<p>Afterward, a pop-up window will appear where you will be prompted to browse your computer for the aforementioned images Click ‘OK’ when done</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Upload Images into Image Stack"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 2: Organize Layers</strong></p>
<p>Check the ‘Layers’ panel for the images that you uploaded and organize them based on how you want them to appear for your animated GIF</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/top-10-best-and-fast-ways-to-turn-image-into-gif7.png"
                      alt="Organize Layers Panel"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: (Optional) Import Video</strong></p>
<p>If you want to work on a video to turn into a GIF instead, you can do such by selecting the ‘File’ tab and clicking on the ‘Import &gt; Video Frames to Layers…’ option. This will get you to the same place shown in Step 2</p>
<p>Note: Just be careful that you do not transfer an image that is too long Photoshop may not be able to properly break it down, if so.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Import Video Frames to Layers"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Open Timeline Then Create Frame Animation</strong></p>
<p>Next, in order to start working on your animation, open the Timeline Window This can be done by clicking the ‘Window’ tab and selecting ‘Timeline’</p>
<p>With the ‘Timeline’ Window now open, select the ‘Create Frame Animation’ option to begin working</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Create Frame Animation on Timeline"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 5: Make Frame from Layers</strong></p>
<p>In order to transfer your uploaded images from the ‘Layers’ panel to your timeline, select the ‘Menu’ option on the top-right hand corner of the ‘Timeline’ window and select the ‘Make Frames From Layers’ option</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Make Frames from Layers Option"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 6: Preview Animation and Adjust as Needed</strong></p>
<p>To preview your animation, click the ‘Play’ button This is the best time to check that your frames have been organized correctly If they are not, you can adjust them by dragging and dropping them on the timeline.</p>
<p>OR, you can use the ‘Reverse Frames’ option if your animation has been completely flipped around</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Preview and Adjust Animation Timeline"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 7: Create an Animation Loop</strong></p>
<p>In order to be a proper looped GIF, the animation should repeat endlessly You can make sure of this by changing the ‘Repeat’ option to ‘Forever’ (as is shown in the image below).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/top-10-best-and-fast-ways-to-turn-image-into-gif12.png"
                      alt="Loop Animation Forever"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 8: Export Finished Animation to Gif</strong></p>
<p>In order to finish turning your <strong>image into GIF</strong>, you’ll need to export it in the proper format This is possible by selecting the ‘File’ tab and then clicking the ‘Export &gt; Save for Web (Legacy)…’ option</p>
<p>A pop-up window should appear where you can control export settings Do so in order to ensure that you have the best outcome</p>

<p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p>
<p>For our last tutorial, we’ll be showing you how to make an animated GIF with the use of Wondershare <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>. Filmora is a video editor, one that is used by professionals all over to produce high-quality content And, of course, as a video editor, it works just as well as a GIF maker. One that you can use to create images into a GIF easily</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: Launch Filmora</strong></p>
<p>First, download and install Filmora If you want to follow along with this demonstration, you can Wondershare offers a FREE trial where you can test out all of the software’s functions before making a commitment</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Upload Video to Turn into GIF</strong></p>
<p>For this next step, we do something akin to what we did earlier with Photoshop. And that is to upload images or a video to fit into a timeline</p>
<p>This process is started by first uploading images, which you can do by clicking the ‘File’ tab and selecting the ‘Import Media &gt; Import Media Files’ option</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/top-10-best-and-fast-ways-to-turn-image-into-gif15.png"
                      alt="Import Media Files on Filmora"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Drag Media to Timeline</strong></p>
<p>With   <strong>Filmora, the ‘Timeline’ window is already open Also, you won’t have to do anything complicated to get your media onto the said timeline. Just drag and drop it from the Media library (as is shown in the image below).</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Drag-and-Drop Media to Filmora Timeline"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Edit or Adjust GIF</strong></p>
<p>Before moving forward, you should take this chance to make adjustments to the media that you uploaded into your timeline There are many things that you can do at this stage so feel free to experiment</p>
<p>For our example, we cut down the video that we uploaded by using the ‘Trim’ option (which you can find by right-clicking on video media).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Trim Uploaded Video"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 5: Export into GIF</strong></p>
<p>Finally, to finish us off, we export our finished GIF This can be done by selecting the ‘Export’ tab and then clicking the ‘Create Video’ option A pop-up window will appear where you can adjust export settings</p>

<p>But, first: Why GIF? Well, it all comes down to what you’re looking for A lot of people use GIF files to create animated icons that they can use for their accounts. Some just genuinely want to create a GIF file that they can share with their friends and families (either for a laugh or something else) GIF files are a convenient vessel for doing this because they have a lot of flexibility and are accepted by most platforms</p>

No one wants that But, how are you supposed to avoid it? Well, it all depends on the tool that you’re using and your initial picture For the former, it’s best to review the upload requirements of your chosen GIF maker to get a better end result. For the latter, it’s best to pick a good, high-quality GIF creator for a better outcome</p>

These occur often with GIF makers that support transparency If you find these happening to you, adjust the transparency settings to get rid of the white pixel outline around your converted GIF.</p>

<p>**<strong>Step 1: Go to Loading.IO</strong></p>
<p>Of course, we start off this tutorial by opening the GIF maker. In this case, since the tool is hosted online, that’s as easy as opening the link that we’ve provided below It will take you directly to the online GIF creator.</p>

                      alt="Launch Online GIF Creator"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 2: Upload Photo</strong></p>
<p>Once on-site, it’s time to upload the photo that you want to turn into a GIF As this is an icon creator, you should pick a photo with the proper parameters</p>
<p>To upload your icon for animating, select the ‘Upload’ button and browse your computer or your Google Drive for the image in question.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Upload Photo to Turn into GIF"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Choose animation Style</strong></p>
<p>Next, choose how you want the uploaded photo to be animated Loading.IO offers a couple of animations that you can choose from Including the ‘beat’ animation, which is what we choose for our example</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Choose GIF Animation Style"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Adjust Settings</strong></p>
<p>This step is technically optional, as there are default settings already prepared if you have no other specifications for your image-turned GIF. But, if you want, you can adjust certain settings for a better outcome</p>
<p>For example, you can speed up the animation with the ‘Speed’ slider. Or, you can increase the number of times the GIF loops by adjusting the ‘Repeat’ slider. Test out a couple of settings to get the best result</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Adjust Slider Settings"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 5: Download as GIF</strong></p>
<p>To wrap things up, it’s time to download your finished animation Loading.IO gives several options for this. But, of course, in our case, we choose to ‘Download As: GIF’</p>

But, it is a very professional method of creating an animated GIF — one that will allow you to control every step of the process (which may be exactly what you want)</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: Import Images into an Image Stack</strong></p>
<p>First, starting on a new product, upload the images that you want to turn into a GIF into a photoshop ‘Image Stack’. This can be done by clicking the ‘File’ tab and selecting the ‘Scripts &gt; Load Files into Stack…’ option</p>
<p>Afterward, a pop-up window will appear where you will be prompted to browse your computer for the aforementioned images Click ‘OK’ when done</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Upload Images into Image Stack"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 2: Organize Layers</strong></p>
<p>Check the ‘Layers’ panel for the images that you uploaded and organize them based on how you want them to appear for your animated GIF</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/top-10-best-and-fast-ways-to-turn-image-into-gif7.png"
                      alt="Organize Layers Panel"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: (Optional) Import Video</strong></p>
<p>If you want to work on a video to turn into a GIF instead, you can do such by selecting the ‘File’ tab and clicking on the ‘Import &gt; Video Frames to Layers…’ option. This will get you to the same place shown in Step 2</p>
<p>Note: Just be careful that you do not transfer an image that is too long Photoshop may not be able to properly break it down, if so.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Import Video Frames to Layers"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Open Timeline Then Create Frame Animation</strong></p>
<p>Next, in order to start working on your animation, open the Timeline Window This can be done by clicking the ‘Window’ tab and selecting ‘Timeline’</p>
<p>With the ‘Timeline’ Window now open, select the ‘Create Frame Animation’ option to begin working</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Create Frame Animation on Timeline"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 5: Make Frame from Layers</strong></p>
<p>In order to transfer your uploaded images from the ‘Layers’ panel to your timeline, select the ‘Menu’ option on the top-right hand corner of the ‘Timeline’ window and select the ‘Make Frames From Layers’ option</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Make Frames from Layers Option"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 6: Preview Animation and Adjust as Needed</strong></p>
<p>To preview your animation, click the ‘Play’ button This is the best time to check that your frames have been organized correctly If they are not, you can adjust them by dragging and dropping them on the timeline.</p>
<p>OR, you can use the ‘Reverse Frames’ option if your animation has been completely flipped around</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Preview and Adjust Animation Timeline"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 7: Create an Animation Loop</strong></p>
<p>In order to be a proper looped GIF, the animation should repeat endlessly You can make sure of this by changing the ‘Repeat’ option to ‘Forever’ (as is shown in the image below).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Loop Animation Forever"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 8: Export Finished Animation to Gif</strong></p>
<p>In order to finish turning your <strong>image into GIF</strong>, you’ll need to export it in the proper format This is possible by selecting the ‘File’ tab and then clicking the ‘Export &gt; Save for Web (Legacy)…’ option</p>
<p>A pop-up window should appear where you can control export settings Do so in order to ensure that you have the best outcome</p>

<p>This process is started by first uploading images, which you can do by clicking the ‘File’ tab and selecting the ‘Import Media &gt; Import Media Files’ option</p>
<p><img

                      alt="Import Media Files on Filmora"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Drag Media to Timeline</strong></p>
<p>With   <strong>Filmora, the ‘Timeline’ window is already open Also, you won’t have to do anything complicated to get your media onto the said timeline. Just drag and drop it from the Media library (as is shown in the image below).</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Drag-and-Drop Media to Filmora Timeline"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Edit or Adjust GIF</strong></p>
<p>Before moving forward, you should take this chance to make adjustments to the media that you uploaded into your timeline There are many things that you can do at this stage so feel free to experiment</p>
<p>For our example, we cut down the video that we uploaded by using the ‘Trim’ option (which you can find by right-clicking on video media).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Trim Uploaded Video"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 5: Export into GIF</strong></p>
<p>Finally, to finish us off, we export our finished GIF This can be done by selecting the ‘Export’ tab and then clicking the ‘Create Video’ option A pop-up window will appear where you can adjust export settings</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

<p>But, first: Why GIF? Well, it all comes down to what you’re looking for A lot of people use GIF files to create animated icons that they can use for their accounts. Some just genuinely want to create a GIF file that they can share with their friends and families (either for a laugh or something else) GIF files are a convenient vessel for doing this because they have a lot of flexibility and are accepted by most platforms</p>

No one wants that But, how are you supposed to avoid it? Well, it all depends on the tool that you’re using and your initial picture For the former, it’s best to review the upload requirements of your chosen GIF maker to get a better end result. For the latter, it’s best to pick a good, high-quality GIF creator for a better outcome</p>

<p>**<strong>Step 1: Go to Loading.IO</strong></p>
<p>Of course, we start off this tutorial by opening the GIF maker. In this case, since the tool is hosted online, that’s as easy as opening the link that we’ve provided below It will take you directly to the online GIF creator.</p>

                      alt="Launch Online GIF Creator"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 2: Upload Photo</strong></p>
<p>Once on-site, it’s time to upload the photo that you want to turn into a GIF As this is an icon creator, you should pick a photo with the proper parameters</p>
<p>To upload your icon for animating, select the ‘Upload’ button and browse your computer or your Google Drive for the image in question.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Upload Photo to Turn into GIF"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Choose animation Style</strong></p>
<p>Next, choose how you want the uploaded photo to be animated Loading.IO offers a couple of animations that you can choose from Including the ‘beat’ animation, which is what we choose for our example</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Choose GIF Animation Style"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Adjust Settings</strong></p>
<p>This step is technically optional, as there are default settings already prepared if you have no other specifications for your image-turned GIF. But, if you want, you can adjust certain settings for a better outcome</p>
<p>For example, you can speed up the animation with the ‘Speed’ slider. Or, you can increase the number of times the GIF loops by adjusting the ‘Repeat’ slider. Test out a couple of settings to get the best result</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Adjust Slider Settings"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 5: Download as GIF</strong></p>
<p>To wrap things up, it’s time to download your finished animation Loading.IO gives several options for this. But, of course, in our case, we choose to ‘Download As: GIF’</p>

But, it is a very professional method of creating an animated GIF — one that will allow you to control every step of the process (which may be exactly what you want)</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: Import Images into an Image Stack</strong></p>
<p>First, starting on a new product, upload the images that you want to turn into a GIF into a photoshop ‘Image Stack’. This can be done by clicking the ‘File’ tab and selecting the ‘Scripts &gt; Load Files into Stack…’ option</p>
<p>Afterward, a pop-up window will appear where you will be prompted to browse your computer for the aforementioned images Click ‘OK’ when done</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Upload Images into Image Stack"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 2: Organize Layers</strong></p>
<p>Check the ‘Layers’ panel for the images that you uploaded and organize them based on how you want them to appear for your animated GIF</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/top-10-best-and-fast-ways-to-turn-image-into-gif7.png"
                      alt="Organize Layers Panel"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: (Optional) Import Video</strong></p>
<p>If you want to work on a video to turn into a GIF instead, you can do such by selecting the ‘File’ tab and clicking on the ‘Import &gt; Video Frames to Layers…’ option. This will get you to the same place shown in Step 2</p>
<p>Note: Just be careful that you do not transfer an image that is too long Photoshop may not be able to properly break it down, if so.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Import Video Frames to Layers"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Open Timeline Then Create Frame Animation</strong></p>
<p>Next, in order to start working on your animation, open the Timeline Window This can be done by clicking the ‘Window’ tab and selecting ‘Timeline’</p>
<p>With the ‘Timeline’ Window now open, select the ‘Create Frame Animation’ option to begin working</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Create Frame Animation on Timeline"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 5: Make Frame from Layers</strong></p>
<p>In order to transfer your uploaded images from the ‘Layers’ panel to your timeline, select the ‘Menu’ option on the top-right hand corner of the ‘Timeline’ window and select the ‘Make Frames From Layers’ option</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Make Frames from Layers Option"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 6: Preview Animation and Adjust as Needed</strong></p>
<p>To preview your animation, click the ‘Play’ button This is the best time to check that your frames have been organized correctly If they are not, you can adjust them by dragging and dropping them on the timeline.</p>
<p>OR, you can use the ‘Reverse Frames’ option if your animation has been completely flipped around</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Preview and Adjust Animation Timeline"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 7: Create an Animation Loop</strong></p>
<p>In order to be a proper looped GIF, the animation should repeat endlessly You can make sure of this by changing the ‘Repeat’ option to ‘Forever’ (as is shown in the image below).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Loop Animation Forever"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 8: Export Finished Animation to Gif</strong></p>
<p>In order to finish turning your <strong>image into GIF</strong>, you’ll need to export it in the proper format This is possible by selecting the ‘File’ tab and then clicking the ‘Export &gt; Save for Web (Legacy)…’ option</p>
<p>A pop-up window should appear where you can control export settings Do so in order to ensure that you have the best outcome</p>

<p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p>
<p>For our last tutorial, we’ll be showing you how to make an animated GIF with the use of Wondershare <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>. Filmora is a video editor, one that is used by professionals all over to produce high-quality content And, of course, as a video editor, it works just as well as a GIF maker. One that you can use to create images into a GIF easily</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: Launch Filmora</strong></p>
<p>First, download and install Filmora If you want to follow along with this demonstration, you can Wondershare offers a FREE trial where you can test out all of the software’s functions before making a commitment</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Upload Video to Turn into GIF</strong></p>
<p>For this next step, we do something akin to what we did earlier with Photoshop. And that is to upload images or a video to fit into a timeline</p>
<p>This process is started by first uploading images, which you can do by clicking the ‘File’ tab and selecting the ‘Import Media &gt; Import Media Files’ option</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Import Media Files on Filmora"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Drag Media to Timeline</strong></p>
<p>With   <strong>Filmora, the ‘Timeline’ window is already open Also, you won’t have to do anything complicated to get your media onto the said timeline. Just drag and drop it from the Media library (as is shown in the image below).</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Drag-and-Drop Media to Filmora Timeline"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Edit or Adjust GIF</strong></p>
<p>Before moving forward, you should take this chance to make adjustments to the media that you uploaded into your timeline There are many things that you can do at this stage so feel free to experiment</p>
<p>For our example, we cut down the video that we uploaded by using the ‘Trim’ option (which you can find by right-clicking on video media).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Trim Uploaded Video"

<p>But, first: Why GIF? Well, it all comes down to what you’re looking for A lot of people use GIF files to create animated icons that they can use for their accounts. Some just genuinely want to create a GIF file that they can share with their friends and families (either for a laugh or something else) GIF files are a convenient vessel for doing this because they have a lot of flexibility and are accepted by most platforms</p>

No one wants that But, how are you supposed to avoid it? Well, it all depends on the tool that you’re using and your initial picture For the former, it’s best to review the upload requirements of your chosen GIF maker to get a better end result. For the latter, it’s best to pick a good, high-quality GIF creator for a better outcome</p>

<p>**<strong>Step 1: Go to Loading.IO</strong></p>
<p>Of course, we start off this tutorial by opening the GIF maker. In this case, since the tool is hosted online, that’s as easy as opening the link that we’ve provided below It will take you directly to the online GIF creator.</p>

                      alt="Launch Online GIF Creator"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 2: Upload Photo</strong></p>
<p>Once on-site, it’s time to upload the photo that you want to turn into a GIF As this is an icon creator, you should pick a photo with the proper parameters</p>
<p>To upload your icon for animating, select the ‘Upload’ button and browse your computer or your Google Drive for the image in question.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Upload Photo to Turn into GIF"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Choose animation Style</strong></p>
<p>Next, choose how you want the uploaded photo to be animated Loading.IO offers a couple of animations that you can choose from Including the ‘beat’ animation, which is what we choose for our example</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Choose GIF Animation Style"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Adjust Settings</strong></p>
<p>This step is technically optional, as there are default settings already prepared if you have no other specifications for your image-turned GIF. But, if you want, you can adjust certain settings for a better outcome</p>
<p>For example, you can speed up the animation with the ‘Speed’ slider. Or, you can increase the number of times the GIF loops by adjusting the ‘Repeat’ slider. Test out a couple of settings to get the best result</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 5: Download as GIF</strong></p>
<p>To wrap things up, it’s time to download your finished animation Loading.IO gives several options for this. But, of course, in our case, we choose to ‘Download As: GIF’</p>

<h3 id="02How-to-Make-an-Animated-GIF-in-Photoshop-Tutorial-3"><a href="#02How-to-Make-an-Animated-GIF-in-Photoshop-Tutorial-3" class="headerlink" title="02How to Make an Animated GIF in Photoshop [Tutorial]"></a>02<strong>How to Make an Animated GIF in Photoshop [Tutorial]</strong></h3><p>For the next tutorial, we’ll be showing you how to use Photoshop to create and edit an animated GIF This process is fairly lengthy and is not recommended for beginners. But, it is a very professional method of creating an animated GIF — one that will allow you to control every step of the process (which may be exactly what you want)</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: Import Images into an Image Stack</strong></p>
<p>First, starting on a new product, upload the images that you want to turn into a GIF into a photoshop ‘Image Stack’. This can be done by clicking the ‘File’ tab and selecting the ‘Scripts &gt; Load Files into Stack…’ option</p>
<p>Afterward, a pop-up window will appear where you will be prompted to browse your computer for the aforementioned images Click ‘OK’ when done</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/top-10-best-and-fast-ways-to-turn-image-into-gif6.png"
                      alt="Upload Images into Image Stack"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 2: Organize Layers</strong></p>
<p>Check the ‘Layers’ panel for the images that you uploaded and organize them based on how you want them to appear for your animated GIF</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/top-10-best-and-fast-ways-to-turn-image-into-gif7.png"
                      alt="Organize Layers Panel"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: (Optional) Import Video</strong></p>
<p>If you want to work on a video to turn into a GIF instead, you can do such by selecting the ‘File’ tab and clicking on the ‘Import &gt; Video Frames to Layers…’ option. This will get you to the same place shown in Step 2</p>
<p>Note: Just be careful that you do not transfer an image that is too long Photoshop may not be able to properly break it down, if so.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Import Video Frames to Layers"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Open Timeline Then Create Frame Animation</strong></p>
<p>Next, in order to start working on your animation, open the Timeline Window This can be done by clicking the ‘Window’ tab and selecting ‘Timeline’</p>
<p>With the ‘Timeline’ Window now open, select the ‘Create Frame Animation’ option to begin working</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Create Frame Animation on Timeline"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 5: Make Frame from Layers</strong></p>
<p>In order to transfer your uploaded images from the ‘Layers’ panel to your timeline, select the ‘Menu’ option on the top-right hand corner of the ‘Timeline’ window and select the ‘Make Frames From Layers’ option</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Make Frames from Layers Option"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 6: Preview Animation and Adjust as Needed</strong></p>
<p>To preview your animation, click the ‘Play’ button This is the best time to check that your frames have been organized correctly If they are not, you can adjust them by dragging and dropping them on the timeline.</p>
<p>OR, you can use the ‘Reverse Frames’ option if your animation has been completely flipped around</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Preview and Adjust Animation Timeline"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 7: Create an Animation Loop</strong></p>
<p>In order to be a proper looped GIF, the animation should repeat endlessly You can make sure of this by changing the ‘Repeat’ option to ‘Forever’ (as is shown in the image below).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Loop Animation Forever"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 8: Export Finished Animation to Gif</strong></p>
<p>In order to finish turning your <strong>image into GIF</strong>, you’ll need to export it in the proper format This is possible by selecting the ‘File’ tab and then clicking the ‘Export &gt; Save for Web (Legacy)…’ option</p>
<p>A pop-up window should appear where you can control export settings Do so in order to ensure that you have the best outcome</p>

<p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p>
<p>For our last tutorial, we’ll be showing you how to make an animated GIF with the use of Wondershare <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>. Filmora is a video editor, one that is used by professionals all over to produce high-quality content And, of course, as a video editor, it works just as well as a GIF maker. One that you can use to create images into a GIF easily</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: Launch Filmora</strong></p>
<p>First, download and install Filmora If you want to follow along with this demonstration, you can Wondershare offers a FREE trial where you can test out all of the software’s functions before making a commitment</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/top-10-best-and-fast-ways-to-turn-image-into-gif14.png"
                      alt="Download and Install Wondershare&#39;s Filmora"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Upload Video to Turn into GIF</strong></p>
<p>For this next step, we do something akin to what we did earlier with Photoshop. And that is to upload images or a video to fit into a timeline</p>
<p>This process is started by first uploading images, which you can do by clicking the ‘File’ tab and selecting the ‘Import Media &gt; Import Media Files’ option</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/top-10-best-and-fast-ways-to-turn-image-into-gif15.png"
                      alt="Import Media Files on Filmora"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Drag Media to Timeline</strong></p>
<p>With   <strong>Filmora, the ‘Timeline’ window is already open Also, you won’t have to do anything complicated to get your media onto the said timeline. Just drag and drop it from the Media library (as is shown in the image below).</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Drag-and-Drop Media to Filmora Timeline"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Edit or Adjust GIF</strong></p>
<p>Before moving forward, you should take this chance to make adjustments to the media that you uploaded into your timeline There are many things that you can do at this stage so feel free to experiment</p>
<p>For our example, we cut down the video that we uploaded by using the ‘Trim’ option (which you can find by right-clicking on video media).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Trim Uploaded Video"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 5: Export into GIF</strong></p>
<p>Finally, to finish us off, we export our finished GIF This can be done by selecting the ‘Export’ tab and then clicking the ‘Create Video’ option A pop-up window will appear where you can adjust export settings</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

<p>Blender is a FREE, open-source 3D Animation program that is very popular for beginner animators. It’s a good way of starting if you’re not yet sure about how far you want to go into animation as it won’t demand any immediate monetary commitment.</p>
<p>Now, as for its features, today, we’ll be focusing on <strong>Blender Rigging</strong> features.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-Why-Use-Blender-Rigging"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Use-Blender-Rigging" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Why Use Blender Rigging?"></a>Part 1 <strong>Why Use Blender Rigging?</strong></h2><p><strong>Blender Character Rigging</strong> is a great way of creating truly beautiful and realistic animations. Despite being an open-source program, it’s capable of doing just as much, if not more, than some of the more premium Animation software out there.</p>
<p>So, if you want to create video projects for your audience’s entertainment or edification with animation, then <strong>Blender Rigging</strong> is definitely something that you should consider. With this tool, you can create the complex animations that you need and then polish it up in a video editor like <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> (which is a premium, video-editing tool that you can use to perfect your finished <strong>Blender Rigging</strong> animations.)</p>

<p>These topics are each very long-winded on their own though, so we’ve linked appropriate video tutorials that you can learn more and reserved ourselves to a brief description of each technique so that you can determine whether it’s something that interests you (although, of course, our recommendation is that you check each one out so that you can get the full ‘Blender’ experience.)</p>
<h3 id="01Blender-Character-Rigging"><a href="#01Blender-Character-Rigging" class="headerlink" title="01Blender Character Rigging"></a>01<strong>Blender Character Rigging</strong></h3><p>The main thing people usually look at Blender for is, <strong>Blender Character Rigging</strong>. And, because it was created to emulate professional animation software, Blender has this function down to pat. To give you an idea of what features you can expect: Blender comes with custom bone shapes for easy <strong>Blender character rigging</strong>, it also comes with envelope skinny, skeleton skinning, and automatic skinning. With these alone, you can be assured that you will be able to create complex animations without much trouble.</p>
<h3 id="02Blender-Facial-Rigging"><a href="#02Blender-Facial-Rigging" class="headerlink" title="02Blender Facial Rigging"></a>02<strong>Blender Facial Rigging</strong></h3><p>Facial Rigging is usually a more complex subject that is avoided by animators without much experience. But, with Blender, facial rigging is possible. The YouTube video should show you the process of going about <strong>Blender Facial Rigging</strong> from start to finish (from sculpting the character face itself and then making use of <strong>Blender Rigging</strong> tools for setting up a skeletal structure for your face’s character to become animated.)</p>
<h3 id="03Blender-Muscle-Rigging"><a href="#03Blender-Muscle-Rigging" class="headerlink" title="03Blender Muscle Rigging"></a>03<strong>Blender Muscle Rigging</strong></h3><p>Creating a <strong>Blender Muscle Rig</strong> is exactly what it sounds like. It is, of course, much more complicated than normal rigging, but it is a good subject to familiarize yourself with anyway, as it will allow you to go to the ‘next stage’ as you say, with your Animations. The video that we’ve attached is from Pierrick Picaut, who has released a series of videos on the subject of <strong>Blender Rigging</strong> in general and has extensively explained how to create a <strong>Blender Human Rig</strong> from the general body, the face, the muscles, and so on.</p>
<h3 id="04Blender-Rigging"><a href="#04Blender-Rigging" class="headerlink" title="04Blender Rigging"></a>04<strong>Blender Rigging</strong></h3><p>Although a lot of Animation relies on more ‘traditional’ methods of expressing movement, one can still make use of more modern animation practices, like rigs, to set up their animations for movement. It’s an especially good skill to learn if you’re more interested in content-friendly animations (rather than creating a film of your own.)</p>
<h3 id="05Blender-Rigging"><a href="#05Blender-Rigging" class="headerlink" title="05Blender Rigging"></a>05<strong>Blender Rigging</strong></h3><p>This next tutorial is an introduction to basic <strong>Blender Rigging</strong>. It’s a good one to both start and end on, as it was created for beginners specifically, and uses an example that is perhaps easier to understand most. Make sure to give it a shot just in case.</p>

Whether it be about <strong>Blender character rigging</strong>, <strong>Blender facial rigging</strong>, <strong>free blender rigs, creating muscle rigs</strong>, and so and so forth. These resources have got your back.</p>
<h3 id="01Where-to-Learn-the-Course"><a href="#01Where-to-Learn-the-Course" class="headerlink" title="01Where to Learn the Course?"></a>01<strong>Where to Learn the Course?</strong></h3><p>The first major course that we think you might be interested in is Mark Masters’ <strong>blender rigging</strong> course. You can find this course at PluralSight (which is a website that is focused on helping users of software develop their skills). Mark Masters, the instructor for this course, is a professional animator and works as a Animator for the animation studio, Steelhouse Productions. So, you can be sure that there is much that you can learn from him.</p>

<p>Blender is a FREE, open-source 3D Animation program that is very popular for beginner animators. It’s a good way of starting if you’re not yet sure about how far you want to go into animation as it won’t demand any immediate monetary commitment.</p>
<p>Now, as for its features, today, we’ll be focusing on <strong>Blender Rigging</strong> features.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-Why-Use-Blender-Rigging-3"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Use-Blender-Rigging-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Why Use Blender Rigging?"></a>Part 1 <strong>Why Use Blender Rigging?</strong></h2><p><strong>Blender Character Rigging</strong> is a great way of creating truly beautiful and realistic animations. Despite being an open-source program, it’s capable of doing just as much, if not more, than some of the more premium Animation software out there.</p>
<p>So, if you want to create video projects for your audience’s entertainment or edification with animation, then <strong>Blender Rigging</strong> is definitely something that you should consider. With this tool, you can create the complex animations that you need and then polish it up in a video editor like <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> (which is a premium, video-editing tool that you can use to perfect your finished <strong>Blender Rigging</strong> animations.)</p>

<h2 id="Part-2-The-Art-of-Effective-Rigging-in-Blender-TUTORIAL-3"><a href="#Part-2-The-Art-of-Effective-Rigging-in-Blender-TUTORIAL-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 The Art of Effective Rigging in Blender [TUTORIAL]"></a>Part 2 <strong>The Art of Effective Rigging in Blender [TUTORIAL]</strong></h2><p>For this next section, we’re going to be introducing a couple of tutorials that you can look into to teach you more about <strong>Blender Character Rigging</strong>, <strong>Blender Facial Rigging</strong>, <strong>Blender Muscle Rig</strong>, and so on.</p>
<p>These topics are each very long-winded on their own though, so we’ve linked appropriate video tutorials that you can learn more and reserved ourselves to a brief description of each technique so that you can determine whether it’s something that interests you (although, of course, our recommendation is that you check each one out so that you can get the full ‘Blender’ experience.)</p>
<h3 id="01Blender-Character-Rigging-3"><a href="#01Blender-Character-Rigging-3" class="headerlink" title="01Blender Character Rigging"></a>01<strong>Blender Character Rigging</strong></h3><p>The main thing people usually look at Blender for is, <strong>Blender Character Rigging</strong>. And, because it was created to emulate professional animation software, Blender has this function down to pat. To give you an idea of what features you can expect: Blender comes with custom bone shapes for easy <strong>Blender character rigging</strong>, it also comes with envelope skinny, skeleton skinning, and automatic skinning. With these alone, you can be assured that you will be able to create complex animations without much trouble.</p>
<h3 id="02Blender-Facial-Rigging-3"><a href="#02Blender-Facial-Rigging-3" class="headerlink" title="02Blender Facial Rigging"></a>02<strong>Blender Facial Rigging</strong></h3><p>Facial Rigging is usually a more complex subject that is avoided by animators without much experience. But, with Blender, facial rigging is possible. The YouTube video should show you the process of going about <strong>Blender Facial Rigging</strong> from start to finish (from sculpting the character face itself and then making use of <strong>Blender Rigging</strong> tools for setting up a skeletal structure for your face’s character to become animated.)</p>
<h3 id="03Blender-Muscle-Rigging-3"><a href="#03Blender-Muscle-Rigging-3" class="headerlink" title="03Blender Muscle Rigging"></a>03<strong>Blender Muscle Rigging</strong></h3><p>Creating a <strong>Blender Muscle Rig</strong> is exactly what it sounds like. It is, of course, much more complicated than normal rigging, but it is a good subject to familiarize yourself with anyway, as it will allow you to go to the ‘next stage’ as you say, with your Animations. The video that we’ve attached is from Pierrick Picaut, who has released a series of videos on the subject of <strong>Blender Rigging</strong> in general and has extensively explained how to create a <strong>Blender Human Rig</strong> from the general body, the face, the muscles, and so on.</p>
<h3 id="04Blender-Rigging-3"><a href="#04Blender-Rigging-3" class="headerlink" title="04Blender Rigging"></a>04<strong>Blender Rigging</strong></h3><p>Although a lot of Animation relies on more ‘traditional’ methods of expressing movement, one can still make use of more modern animation practices, like rigs, to set up their animations for movement. It’s an especially good skill to learn if you’re more interested in content-friendly animations (rather than creating a film of your own.)</p>
<h3 id="05Blender-Rigging-3"><a href="#05Blender-Rigging-3" class="headerlink" title="05Blender Rigging"></a>05<strong>Blender Rigging</strong></h3><p>This next tutorial is an introduction to basic <strong>Blender Rigging</strong>. It’s a good one to both start and end on, as it was created for beginners specifically, and uses an example that is perhaps easier to understand most. Make sure to give it a shot just in case.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-Introduction-to-Rigging-in-Blender-Course-3"><a href="#Part-3-Introduction-to-Rigging-in-Blender-Course-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 Introduction to Rigging in Blender Course"></a>Part 3 <strong>Introduction to Rigging in Blender Course</strong></h2><p>For this next part, we introduce two other resources that you can take advantage of to learn more about <strong>Blender Rigging</strong>. Whether it be about <strong>Blender character rigging</strong>, <strong>Blender facial rigging</strong>, <strong>free blender rigs, creating muscle rigs</strong>, and so and so forth. These resources have got your back.</p>
<h3 id="01Where-to-Learn-the-Course-3"><a href="#01Where-to-Learn-the-Course-3" class="headerlink" title="01Where to Learn the Course?"></a>01<strong>Where to Learn the Course?</strong></h3><p>The first major course that we think you might be interested in is Mark Masters’ <strong>blender rigging</strong> course. You can find this course at PluralSight (which is a website that is focused on helping users of software develop their skills). Mark Masters, the instructor for this course, is a professional animator and works as a Animator for the animation studio, Steelhouse Productions. So, you can be sure that there is much that you can learn from him.</p>
