<p>Emojis formerly reigned supreme, but GIFs and memes have since supplanted them. When you add a GIF to a conversation, it becomes more exciting. GIFs are considerably better at communicating our feelings, and they deserve credit for that. Pinterest, like other social networking sites and chat apps, enables GIFs. Pinterest is a photo-sharing website where you can find home decor ideas, recipes, fashion inspiration, DIY projects, and more.</p>
<p>Compared to a static image, adding a GIF to Pinterest conveys more information. You can make GIFs for your DIY projects or use them to display all sides of a cushion, which would typically require many images. But what if you like a GIF you found on Pinterest? What’s the best way to get it? That is what we will demonstrate here. This article will show how to <strong>download Pinterest GIFs</strong> to your computer and mobile device.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 4: Drawing A Cartoon Nose</strong></p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 5: Shaping the Face</strong></p>
<p>In shaping the face, one needs to be mindful of the character, which will help to determine how to shape the jawline and head. For example, for a girl, the face should be narrower and have the chin come to a bit of a point at the end, whereas, for a boy, it requires that the face is a bit bolder and focuses more on the definition of the jawline.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 5: Shaping the Face</strong></p>
<p>In shaping the face, one needs to be mindful of the character, which will help to determine how to shape the jawline and head. For example, for a girl, the face should be narrower and have the chin come to a bit of a point at the end, whereas, for a boy, it requires that the face is a bit bolder and focuses more on the definition of the jawline.</p>

In addition, the amount of lift under a person’s eyebrows can help determine whether a person is mad or not.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 1: Plan and Prepare</strong></p>
<p>This is the first step is to plan out exactly what this character will convery through its expression while drawing a cartoon character.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 2: Drawing A Cartoon Head</strong></p>
<p>Next is time to start sketching out the shape of the head based on the plan you have made. Whatsoever shape you decide to use for your character, start with a circle to serve as the basic shape for the head.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 3: Drawing Cartoon Eyes</strong></p>
<p>Now, you need to draw the eye of the character, which is a crucial step because the eye is the essential part of their expression. To get the character’s eyes in the right place, you should carefully sketch the horizontal or vertical dimension lines.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 4: Drawing A Cartoon Nose</strong></p>

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 5: Shaping the Face</strong></p>
<p>In shaping the face, one needs to be mindful of the character, which will help to determine how to shape the jawline and head. For example, for a girl, the face should be narrower and have the chin come to a bit of a point at the end, whereas, for a boy, it requires that the face is a bit bolder and focuses more on the definition of the jawline.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 1: Plan and Prepare</strong></p>
<p>This is the first step is to plan out exactly what this character will convery through its expression while drawing a cartoon character.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 2: Drawing A Cartoon Head</strong></p>
<p>Next is time to start sketching out the shape of the head based on the plan you have made. Whatsoever shape you decide to use for your character, start with a circle to serve as the basic shape for the head.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 3: Drawing Cartoon Eyes</strong></p>
<p>Now, you need to draw the eye of the character, which is a crucial step because the eye is the essential part of their expression. To get the character’s eyes in the right place, you should carefully sketch the horizontal or vertical dimension lines.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 4: Drawing A Cartoon Nose</strong></p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 5: Shaping the Face</strong></p>
<p>In shaping the face, one needs to be mindful of the character, which will help to determine how to shape the jawline and head. For example, for a girl, the face should be narrower and have the chin come to a bit of a point at the end, whereas, for a boy, it requires that the face is a bit bolder and focuses more on the definition of the jawline.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 6: Drawing A Cartoon Mouth</strong></p>

<p>Let me ask you a question - how much fun would it be if you could create your own animated stickers and send them to your friends and family members on Whatsapp?

Well, to tell you the truth, it is possible to create <strong>Whatsapp cartoons</strong> and stickers, and the best part is you don’t need any technical expertise to get the job done.</p>
<p>Of course, for a long time, Whatsapp didn’t allow its users to use third-party animated stickers within the messenger. But, recently the messaging platform introduced a custom “stickers pack” feature that now allows people to upload their own stickers and create a dedicated sticker app.</p>
