<p>Creating an animation requires multiple processes and tasks to get that final result that we enjoy on the screen. Irrespective of the type of animations like stop-motion, sketch, computer, and others, all of them majorly falls under two main categories- 2D animation and 3D animation. The popular cartoons like Mickey Mouse, Tom &amp; Jerry, and others that became an integral part of all childhood were 2D animations and with technological advancement and 3D animation in use, they are more like aged-veterans.</p>

<p>Toy Story was the first 3D animation movie and after that, there is no stopping. Though 3D animations are more interesting and engaging, they are fields where 2D animations work better. This article will help you to learn in detail about 2D 3D animation, their differences, uses, and other aspects.</p>

A 2D animated video has multiple images in different positions which when moved quickly one after the other simulates a movement. The flipping of the images creates an illusion of movement. Earlier 2D animations were created using hands but now there is advanced computer software that can create these animations in just a few simple clicks. The term 2D means 2 dimensional which means that an image for the animation can be moved in two-dimensional space that is X-axis and Y-axis.</p>
<h3 id="023D-Animation"><a href="#023D-Animation" class="headerlink" title="023D Animation"></a>023D Animation</h3><p>In simplest terms, a 3D animation is an animation that is created in three-dimensional space which makes the characters and objects appear realistic and lively. Thus, a 3D animation has height, width as well as depth. These animations are more complex and the process of creating them is totally different from that of 2D animations. Though 3D animations are used in different industries and platforms these days, majorly they can be found for creating movies, games, and cartoons.</p>

While a 2D animation appears like a flat animation which can be an image or a photograph at a fast movement while a 3D animation looks like real objects that can be seen from all angles and have their front, back, top, as well as the bottom.</p>

Several factors can be considered to select between the two types of animations. Major ones are enlisted below.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Target audience: For general explanation and use, 2D animations are a good choice as they are interesting, engaging, and also pocket-friendly. If the target audience is professional people that need in-depth and important information about something, 3D animations are a better choice.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Availability of software: There are different software used for different types of animations. The availability of the software can also be a deciding factor for selecting between a 2D animation or 3D animation.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Budget: This is another important factor to be considered. Since 3D animation requires more complex tools and procedures, creating them is expensive. So, depending on how much you are willing to spend, you can choose between the two.</p>

<p>Toy Story was the first 3D animation movie and after that, there is no stopping. Though 3D animations are more interesting and engaging, they are fields where 2D animations work better. This article will help you to learn in detail about 2D 3D animation, their differences, uses, and other aspects.</p>

A 2D animated video has multiple images in different positions which when moved quickly one after the other simulates a movement. The flipping of the images creates an illusion of movement. Earlier 2D animations were created using hands but now there is advanced computer software that can create these animations in just a few simple clicks. The term 2D means 2 dimensional which means that an image for the animation can be moved in two-dimensional space that is X-axis and Y-axis.</p>
<h3 id="023D-Animation-2"><a href="#023D-Animation-2" class="headerlink" title="023D Animation"></a>023D Animation</h3><p>In simplest terms, a 3D animation is an animation that is created in three-dimensional space which makes the characters and objects appear realistic and lively. Thus, a 3D animation has height, width as well as depth. These animations are more complex and the process of creating them is totally different from that of 2D animations. Though 3D animations are used in different industries and platforms these days, majorly they can be found for creating movies, games, and cartoons.</p>

While a 2D animation appears like a flat animation which can be an image or a photograph at a fast movement while a 3D animation looks like real objects that can be seen from all angles and have their front, back, top, as well as the bottom.</p>

Several factors can be considered to select between the two types of animations. Major ones are enlisted below.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Target audience: For general explanation and use, 2D animations are a good choice as they are interesting, engaging, and also pocket-friendly. If the target audience is professional people that need in-depth and important information about something, 3D animations are a better choice.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Availability of software: There are different software used for different types of animations. The availability of the software can also be a deciding factor for selecting between a 2D animation or 3D animation.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Budget: This is another important factor to be considered. Since 3D animation requires more complex tools and procedures, creating them is expensive. So, depending on how much you are willing to spend, you can choose between the two.</p>

<p>Creating an animation requires multiple processes and tasks to get that final result that we enjoy on the screen. Irrespective of the type of animations like stop-motion, sketch, computer, and others, all of them majorly falls under two main categories- 2D animation and 3D animation. The popular cartoons like Mickey Mouse, Tom &amp; Jerry, and others that became an integral part of all childhood were 2D animations and with technological advancement and 3D animation in use, they are more like aged-veterans.</p>

<p>The perfect, if not the best, place to begin <strong>cartoon drawing style</strong> as an artist is drawings or sketches since you don’t need a lot of drawing equipment to start this type of drawing. What you chiefly need is just your pen and paper to begin.</p>
<p>So, let’s move ahead as this content will show you different <strong>cartoon drawing styles</strong>, and in no time, you’ll master the art.</p>
<h4 id="In-this-article-4"><a href="#In-this-article-4" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 [15 Types of Cartoon You May Use for Your Next Marketing Project](#Part 1)</p>
<p>02 [How To Draw Myself In Five Different Cartoon Styles](#Part 2)</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-Types-of-Cartoon-You-May-Use-for-Your-Next-Marketing-Project"><a href="#Part-1-Types-of-Cartoon-You-May-Use-for-Your-Next-Marketing-Project" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Types of Cartoon You May Use for Your Next Marketing Project"></a>Part 1 Types of Cartoon You May Use for Your Next Marketing Project</h2><p>As I’ve mentioned before, there are various types and styles of cartoon drawings. Below are a few cartoon drawing styles you may want to use for your next project.</p>
<h3 id="01Modern-Cartoon-Style"><a href="#01Modern-Cartoon-Style" class="headerlink" title="01Modern Cartoon Style"></a>01Modern Cartoon Style</h3><p>This style is currently the most common art style displayed on TV channels like Cartoon Network.</p>
<p>Note that this <strong>cartoon-style drawing’s</strong> main features are the thick outlines, geometric shapes, and bright colors.</p>
<p>One of the significant reasons this drawing style is this way is that using simple shapes without much detail makes the overall animation process much faster and saves resources for the studios. Nonetheless, it is a beautiful and captivating <strong>cartoon drawing style</strong>!</p>
<p>This drawing style is used by many modern cartoons. Here are a few examples:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The Powerpuff Girls</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Dexter’s Laboratory</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Codename: Kids Next Door</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Gravity Falls</p>
<h3 id="02Realistic-Cartoon-Style"><a href="#02Realistic-Cartoon-Style" class="headerlink" title="02Realistic Cartoon Style"></a>02Realistic Cartoon Style</h3><p>This <strong>cartoon drawing style</strong> is more quirky since, generally, cartoon drawing is more likely to simplify shapes. The realistic <strong>cartoon-style drawing</strong> adds more details and keeps figures much more in line with reality. This drawing style is typical among artists who vectorize people’s photographs.</p>
<p>You can also, to some extent, include Caricatures in this category. Caricatures are generally very realistic besides the whole enlargement and shrinking of specific body parts!</p>
<p>Few examples of realistic cartoon drawing styles:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Ugly Americans</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> General Caricataures</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Archer</p>
<h3 id="03Modern-Anime"><a href="#03Modern-Anime" class="headerlink" title="03Modern Anime"></a>03Modern Anime</h3><p>This style tends to be more complex, primarily seen in drawings where the characters seem to be in motion, like in comic books. Modern-day drawings of this style have a lot of shadows and highlights in their character and environment, giving them a relatively new level of complexity.</p>
<p>Here are a few examples of modern animes that follow this Japanese <strong>cartoon drawing style</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> My Hero Academia</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Sword Art Online</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Attack on Titan</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood</p>
<h3 id="04Classic-Manga"><a href="#04Classic-Manga" class="headerlink" title="04Classic Manga"></a>04Classic Manga</h3><p>The old Japanese manga characters tend to possess human-like attributes (proportions) in terms of the body. The difference is the big eyes they have the most time.</p>
<p>Generally, this <strong>cartoon drawing style</strong> focuses more on feminine bodies, possessing angular chins and thin bodies. Some drawing styles tend to make some parts of the body overtly long compared to the rest of the body; for instance, the legs are mostly longer than other parts.</p>
<p>A few examples of classic manga possessing this <strong>cartoon style drawing</strong> are:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Oh My Goddess</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Urusei Yatsura</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Sailor Moon</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Hellsing</p>
<h3 id="05Chibi-Drawing-Style"><a href="#05Chibi-Drawing-Style" class="headerlink" title="05Chibi Drawing Style"></a>05Chibi Drawing Style</h3><p>The Chibi <strong>Cartoon Drawing Style</strong> mainly focuses on making the characters into a tiny version of themselves as if being compressed or compacted into a small container.</p>
<p>Examples of where this drawing style is used:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Lucky Star</p>

<p>Note that this <strong>cartoon-style drawing’s</strong> main features are the thick outlines, geometric shapes, and bright colors.</p>
<p>One of the significant reasons this drawing style is this way is that using simple shapes without much detail makes the overall animation process much faster and saves resources for the studios. Nonetheless, it is a beautiful and captivating <strong>cartoon drawing style</strong>!</p>
<p>This drawing style is used by many modern cartoons. Here are a few examples:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The Powerpuff Girls</p>

The realistic <strong>cartoon-style drawing</strong> adds more details and keeps figures much more in line with reality. This drawing style is typical among artists who vectorize people’s photographs.</p>
<p>You can also, to some extent, include Caricatures in this category. Caricatures are generally very realistic besides the whole enlargement and shrinking of specific body parts!</p>

<p>Generally, this <strong>cartoon drawing style</strong> focuses more on feminine bodies, possessing angular chins and thin bodies. Some drawing styles tend to make some parts of the body overtly long compared to the rest of the body; for instance, the legs are mostly longer than other parts.</p>

<p>“Where is everyone getting their <strong>3D Text Animation</strong> templates?”</p>
<p>To answer this request, we’ve compiled a guide that not only teaches you how to create things like <strong>3D Spinning Text (After Effects)</strong> but also gives you an idea of where you can find the kind of resources (i.e., <strong>3D Text Animation</strong> templates and presets) that you need to get a head start on your projects.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What’s-3D-Text-Animation"><a href="#Part-1-What’s-3D-Text-Animation" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What’s 3D Text Animation?"></a>Part 1 What’s 3D Text Animation?</h2><p>Before anything else, let’s talk about text animation. Specifically, 3D Text Animation. The text that you’re reading now, is 2D Text. It’s static, and it lacks depth. It’s just letters on a screen. Meanwhile, 3D Text is usually built for motion, and thus, it has volume and depth — it’s almost tangible. Here’s what that looks like:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="3D Text Example Yay"
                ></p>
<p>As you can see, even without actually moving, in the text shown in the image above, the potential for motion is there — it looks alive.</p>
<p>Now, you’ll see 3D text like this often in movies or promotions. Usually in the form of extravagant title cards or <strong>3D text logo animation</strong>. They’re eye-catching, and because they’re 3D, you can play with them as much as you want to really add drama to your creations.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-Do-I-Make-3D-Text-in-After-Effects"><a href="#Part-2-How-Do-I-Make-3D-Text-in-After-Effects" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How Do I Make 3D Text in After Effects?"></a>Part 2 <strong>How Do I Make 3D Text in After Effects?</strong></h2><p>As promised, this next section will teach you how to create <strong>3D Text Animation</strong> in Adobe After Effects, which is a VFX and motion graphics software used by many animators to bring life to their text. You’ll notice that the following tutorial is really more about introducing the tools that you can use in order to create <strong>3D Text Animation</strong>:</p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Add-Your-Text"><a href="#01Step-1-Add-Your-Text" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1. Add Your Text"></a>01Step 1. Add Your Text</h3><p>The first thing that you have to do, of course, is to add your text! To do this, go to the ‘Tools’ panel, select the Type tool, and then select the ‘Composition’ panel. The composition is where you type your text!</p>
<p>With After Effects, you also have the following options:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Change Text Font</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Adjust Text Size</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Adjust Text Color</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Shift Justification (Left, Middle, right)</p>
<p>And so on! Once you’re done with your text composition, it will be generated by After Effects into a layer that you can adjust as needed in the next steps.</p>
<p><img

                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<h3 id="01Step-2-Use-Animation-Presets"><a href="#01Step-2-Use-Animation-Presets" class="headerlink" title="01Step 2. Use Animation Presets"></a>01Step 2. Use Animation Presets</h3><p>With your text now in a layer that you can add animations to… you’ve practically done a third of the job! Or even more than that if you decide to use the animation presets that are provided by After Effects.</p>
<p>These can be found by selecting ‘Browse Presets…’ on the ‘Animation’ tab (shown in the image below.) All you need to apply them is to drag and drop them onto your text layer.</p>
<p>Note: The first keyframe of this built-in text animation will be applied at the location of the Current Time Indicator (CTI), so make sure that you’ve adjusted that accordingly.</p>
<p><img

Per-Character Animation</h3><p>If you’d like to personalize your text animation, After Effects does also give you the option to animate per character (or, per letter, in this case.)</p>
<p>This will give you more control over how you decided to animate your text. Of course, it does mean that it is slightly more complicated as well.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> To animate text per layer, select ‘animate’ on that layer and choose a parameter to start working on animations for.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You’ll be able to previous (or scrub) through your animations in order to see if they are doing what you need them to do.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can also remove applied parameters in order to re-work your animation.</p>

Each template will have a link that you can go to in order to see what it looks like, as well as an explanation on how you can use it for your projects in the future!</p>
<h3 id="01Real-3D-Light-Bulb-Kit"><a href="#01Real-3D-Light-Bulb-Kit" class="headerlink" title="01Real 3D Light Bulb Kit"></a>01Real 3D Light Bulb Kit</h3><p>The first Text Animation Template on our list is the “Logo Light Bulb” 3D Animation from Envato Elements. This one literally glows people! Making it perfect for a quirky, and yet still very impressive Title Card or Logo. Its design is very realistic, and you can also control how it flickers! For example, turning the bulbs on certain characters first, or turning them all off at once in the end.</p>
<h3 id="023D-Text-Reveal"><a href="#023D-Text-Reveal" class="headerlink" title="023D Text Reveal"></a>023D Text Reveal</h3><p>This next 3D Animation template is also from Envato Market. And, just like the first, it makes for quite the dramatic Title Card or Logo. With this template, your Text can literally zoom in to view while looking its best and sparkiest in High-Chrome.</p>
<h3 id="033D-Metallic-Text-Animation"><a href="#033D-Metallic-Text-Animation" class="headerlink" title="033D Metallic Text Animation"></a>033D Metallic Text Animation</h3><p>Our next pick, the 3D Metallic text animation is another great one for those who are looking for something flashy — something that gives off the impression of being impressive right from the gate. Compared to the previous text animation template, this one has a more rugged kind of appearance. Perfect for those looking to promote something more fun rather than professional.</p>
<h3 id="043D-Text-Box-Animation-Pack"><a href="#043D-Text-Box-Animation-Pack" class="headerlink" title="043D Text Box Animation Pack"></a>043D Text Box Animation Pack</h3><p>The next one is a little less ‘impressive’ — in the sense that it isn’t as in your face as the other 3D animation templates that we’ve introduced thus far. And that’s exactly why the 3D Text Box Animation Pack deserves to be on this list! Its <strong>3D spinning text (after effects)</strong> elements are very usable — in that it can work for a variety of individuals and styles. It has a more professional look as well. Making it perfect for corporations.</p>
<h3 id="053D-Text-Logo-Boxes"><a href="#053D-Text-Logo-Boxes" class="headerlink" title="053D Text &amp; Logo Boxes"></a>053D Text &amp; Logo Boxes</h3><p>This next one, the 3D Text &amp; Logo Boxes pack is particularly perfect for 3D logos. The pack gives you several options for box size as well as text parameters. So, you can design your animated 3D Logo however you want and use it for future projects to give them even more dimension than before.</p>
<h3 id="06The-Light-Bulb-Kit"><a href="#06The-Light-Bulb-Kit" class="headerlink" title="06The Light Bulb Kit"></a>06The Light Bulb Kit</h3><p>Our next pick, which is the ‘Light Bulb Kit’ also from Envato, is very similar to the first item on our list — in that it features text lit up by lightbulbs. However, it lends an extra bit of photo-realism to it. Less sparkle and more grain — which may exactly be what you want for your new title card or logo.</p>
<h3 id="073D-Text-Templates"><a href="#073D-Text-Templates" class="headerlink" title="073D Text Templates"></a>073D Text Templates</h3><p>The 3D Text Templates is a very bright and pop-y template that is perfect for creating eye-catching promotions and advertisements. It’s very simple to use, which, again, maybe exactly what you want. Literally, the template will ask you to choose your own text and change the colors to suit that of your own brand, then you’re done!</p>
<h3 id="083D-Text-Shapes-Logo-Reveal"><a href="#083D-Text-Shapes-Logo-Reveal" class="headerlink" title="083D Text Shapes Logo Reveal"></a>083D Text Shapes Logo Reveal</h3><p>The ‘3D Text Shapes Logo Reveal’ template is a pack of 3D text animations that you can use in order to add a little spin to your logo reveals (quite literally, in some cases!) It has a lot of personality to it, and a certain tech-y or science-y feel that would make it perfect for anyone looking for something more technical.</p>
<h3 id="09Bold-Titles"><a href="#09Bold-Titles" class="headerlink" title="09Bold Titles"></a>09Bold Titles</h3><p>The ‘Bold Titles’ template is very loud and proud. But it has a bit of a retro-vibe to it as well. Making it stand out from some of the more minimalistic modern text animation styles that you see these days.</p>
<h3 id="1010-Wave-3D-Logo-Text"><a href="#1010-Wave-3D-Logo-Text" class="headerlink" title="1010. Wave 3D Logo &amp; Text"></a>1010. Wave 3D Logo &amp; Text</h3><p>Looking for something simple and professional? Then the ‘Wave 3D Logo &amp; Text’ template may just be the one for you. We put it last on this list, but it’s actually quite a strong contender. One that just about anyone (for just about any type of project they’re working on), should be able to get some use out of.</p>
<h2 id="Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode"><a href="#Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode" class="headerlink" title="Key Takeaways from This Episode"></a>Key Takeaways from This Episode</h2><p><strong>●</strong> 3D Text Animation is the practice of bringing text to life! It gives dimension, depth, and, even, movement into what are usually very static properties!</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You see a lot of 3D Text Animation in big pictures these days. And you can start creating your own with the use of Adobe After Effects — a VFX and Motion Graphics Software that a lot of professionals use for their own text animation.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Of course, if you don’t have the kind of time to create your own 3D Text Animations from scratch, you can always use templates instead! There are hundreds (if not thousands) of them available out there. It should be simple enough to find one that fits the kind of vibe you’re looking for.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> SECRET TIP! If you’re looking for an all-in-one kind of solution, you might want to consider Filmora Pro. It’s a video editor, first and foremost, but that’s not all it is — you can be using it today to start creating your own 3D Text Animations!</p>

<h3 id="073D-Text-Templates-1"><a href="#073D-Text-Templates-1" class="headerlink" title="073D Text Templates"></a>073D Text Templates</h3><p>The 3D Text Templates is a very bright and pop-y template that is perfect for creating eye-catching promotions and advertisements. It’s very simple to use, which, again, maybe exactly what you want. Literally, the template will ask you to choose your own text and change the colors to suit that of your own brand, then you’re done!</p>
<h3 id="083D-Text-Shapes-Logo-Reveal-1"><a href="#083D-Text-Shapes-Logo-Reveal-1" class="headerlink" title="083D Text Shapes Logo Reveal"></a>083D Text Shapes Logo Reveal</h3><p>The ‘3D Text Shapes Logo Reveal’ template is a pack of 3D text animations that you can use in order to add a little spin to your logo reveals (quite literally, in some cases!) It has a lot of personality to it, and a certain tech-y or science-y feel that would make it perfect for anyone looking for something more technical.</p>
<h3 id="09Bold-Titles-1"><a href="#09Bold-Titles-1" class="headerlink" title="09Bold Titles"></a>09Bold Titles</h3><p>The ‘Bold Titles’ template is very loud and proud. But it has a bit of a retro-vibe to it as well. Making it stand out from some of the more minimalistic modern text animation styles that you see these days.</p>
<h3 id="1010-Wave-3D-Logo-Text-1"><a href="#1010-Wave-3D-Logo-Text-1" class="headerlink" title="1010. Wave 3D Logo &amp; Text"></a>1010.

<h2 id="Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-1"><a href="#Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-1" class="headerlink" title="Key Takeaways from This Episode"></a>Key Takeaways from This Episode</h2><p><strong>●</strong> 3D Text Animation is the practice of bringing text to life! It gives dimension, depth, and, even, movement into what are usually very static properties!</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You see a lot of 3D Text Animation in big pictures these days. And you can start creating your own with the use of Adobe After Effects — a VFX and Motion Graphics Software that a lot of professionals use for their own text animation.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Of course, if you don’t have the kind of time to create your own 3D Text Animations from scratch, you can always use templates instead! There are hundreds (if not thousands) of them available out there. It should be simple enough to find one that fits the kind of vibe you’re looking for.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> SECRET TIP! If you’re looking for an all-in-one kind of solution, you might want to consider Filmora Pro. It’s a video editor, first and foremost, but that’s not all it is — you can be using it today to start creating your own 3D Text Animations!</p>

<p>“Where is everyone getting their <strong>3D Text Animation</strong> templates?”</p>
<p>To answer this request, we’ve compiled a guide that not only teaches you how to create things like <strong>3D Spinning Text (After Effects)</strong> but also gives you an idea of where you can find the kind of resources (i.e., <strong>3D Text Animation</strong> templates and presets) that you need to get a head start on your projects.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What’s-3D-Text-Animation-2"><a href="#Part-1-What’s-3D-Text-Animation-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What’s 3D Text Animation?"></a>Part 1 What’s 3D Text Animation?</h2><p>Before anything else, let’s talk about text animation. Specifically, 3D Text Animation. The text that you’re reading now, is 2D Text. It’s static, and it lacks depth. It’s just letters on a screen. Meanwhile, 3D Text is usually built for motion, and thus, it has volume and depth — it’s almost tangible. Here’s what that looks like:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="3D Text Example Yay"
                ></p>
<p>As you can see, even without actually moving, in the text shown in the image above, the potential for motion is there — it looks alive.</p>
<p>Now, you’ll see 3D text like this often in movies or promotions. Usually in the form of extravagant title cards or <strong>3D text logo animation</strong>. They’re eye-catching, and because they’re 3D, you can play with them as much as you want to really add drama to your creations.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-Do-I-Make-3D-Text-in-After-Effects-2"><a href="#Part-2-How-Do-I-Make-3D-Text-in-After-Effects-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How Do I Make 3D Text in After Effects?"></a>Part 2 <strong>How Do I Make 3D Text in After Effects?</strong></h2><p>As promised, this next section will teach you how to create <strong>3D Text Animation</strong> in Adobe After Effects, which is a VFX and motion graphics software used by many animators to bring life to their text. You’ll notice that the following tutorial is really more about introducing the tools that you can use in order to create <strong>3D Text Animation</strong>:</p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Add-Your-Text-2"><a href="#01Step-1-Add-Your-Text-2" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1. Add Your Text"></a>01Step 1. Add Your Text</h3><p>The first thing that you have to do, of course, is to add your text! To do this, go to the ‘Tools’ panel, select the Type tool, and then select the ‘Composition’ panel. The composition is where you type your text!</p>
<p>With After Effects, you also have the following options:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Change Text Font</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Adjust Text Size</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Adjust Text Color</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Shift Justification (Left, Middle, right)</p>
<p>And so on! Once you’re done with your text composition, it will be generated by After Effects into a layer that you can adjust as needed in the next steps.</p>

Use Animation Presets</h3><p>With your text now in a layer that you can add animations to… you’ve practically done a third of the job! Or even more than that if you decide to use the animation presets that are provided by After Effects.</p>
<p>These can be found by selecting ‘Browse Presets…’ on the ‘Animation’ tab (shown in the image below.) All you need to apply them is to drag and drop them onto your text layer.</p>
<p>Note: The first keyframe of this built-in text animation will be applied at the location of the Current Time Indicator (CTI), so make sure that you’ve adjusted that accordingly.</p>

Per-Character Animation</h3><p>If you’d like to personalize your text animation, After Effects does also give you the option to animate per character (or, per letter, in this case.)</p>
<p>This will give you more control over how you decided to animate your text. Of course, it does mean that it is slightly more complicated as well.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> To animate text per layer, select ‘animate’ on that layer and choose a parameter to start working on animations for.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You’ll be able to previous (or scrub) through your animations in order to see if they are doing what you need them to do.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can also remove applied parameters in order to re-work your animation.</p>

Each template will have a link that you can go to in order to see what it looks like, as well as an explanation on how you can use it for your projects in the future!</p>
<h3 id="01Real-3D-Light-Bulb-Kit-2"><a href="#01Real-3D-Light-Bulb-Kit-2" class="headerlink" title="01Real 3D Light Bulb Kit"></a>01Real 3D Light Bulb Kit</h3><p>The first Text Animation Template on our list is the “Logo Light Bulb” 3D Animation from Envato Elements. This one literally glows people! Making it perfect for a quirky, and yet still very impressive Title Card or Logo. Its design is very realistic, and you can also control how it flickers! For example, turning the bulbs on certain characters first, or turning them all off at once in the end.</p>
<h3 id="023D-Text-Reveal-2"><a href="#023D-Text-Reveal-2" class="headerlink" title="023D Text Reveal"></a>023D Text Reveal</h3><p>This next 3D Animation template is also from Envato Market. And, just like the first, it makes for quite the dramatic Title Card or Logo. With this template, your Text can literally zoom in to view while looking its best and sparkiest in High-Chrome.</p>
<h3 id="033D-Metallic-Text-Animation-2"><a href="#033D-Metallic-Text-Animation-2" class="headerlink" title="033D Metallic Text Animation"></a>033D Metallic Text Animation</h3><p>Our next pick, the 3D Metallic text animation is another great one for those who are looking for something flashy — something that gives off the impression of being impressive right from the gate. Compared to the previous text animation template, this one has a more rugged kind of appearance. Perfect for those looking to promote something more fun rather than professional.</p>
<h3 id="043D-Text-Box-Animation-Pack-2"><a href="#043D-Text-Box-Animation-Pack-2" class="headerlink" title="043D Text Box Animation Pack"></a>043D Text Box Animation Pack</h3><p>The next one is a little less ‘impressive’ — in the sense that it isn’t as in your face as the other 3D animation templates that we’ve introduced thus far. And that’s exactly why the 3D Text Box Animation Pack deserves to be on this list! Its <strong>3D spinning text (after effects)</strong> elements are very usable — in that it can work for a variety of individuals and styles. It has a more professional look as well. Making it perfect for corporations.</p>
<h3 id="053D-Text-Logo-Boxes-2"><a href="#053D-Text-Logo-Boxes-2" class="headerlink" title="053D Text &amp; Logo Boxes"></a>053D Text &amp; Logo Boxes</h3><p>This next one, the 3D Text &amp; Logo Boxes pack is particularly perfect for 3D logos. The pack gives you several options for box size as well as text parameters. So, you can design your animated 3D Logo however you want and use it for future projects to give them even more dimension than before.</p>
<h3 id="06The-Light-Bulb-Kit-2"><a href="#06The-Light-Bulb-Kit-2" class="headerlink" title="06The Light Bulb Kit"></a>06The Light Bulb Kit</h3><p>Our next pick, which is the ‘Light Bulb Kit’ also from Envato, is very similar to the first item on our list — in that it features text lit up by lightbulbs. However, it lends an extra bit of photo-realism to it. Less sparkle and more grain — which may exactly be what you want for your new title card or logo.</p>
<h3 id="073D-Text-Templates-2"><a href="#073D-Text-Templates-2" class="headerlink" title="073D Text Templates"></a>073D Text Templates</h3><p>The 3D Text Templates is a very bright and pop-y template that is perfect for creating eye-catching promotions and advertisements. It’s very simple to use, which, again, maybe exactly what you want. Literally, the template will ask you to choose your own text and change the colors to suit that of your own brand, then you’re done!</p>

It has a lot of personality to it, and a certain tech-y or science-y feel that would make it perfect for anyone looking for something more technical.</p>
<h3 id="09Bold-Titles-2"><a href="#09Bold-Titles-2" class="headerlink" title="09Bold Titles"></a>09Bold Titles</h3><p>The ‘Bold Titles’ template is very loud and proud. But it has a bit of a retro-vibe to it as well. Making it stand out from some of the more minimalistic modern text animation styles that you see these days.</p>
<h3 id="1010-Wave-3D-Logo-Text-2"><a href="#1010-Wave-3D-Logo-Text-2" class="headerlink" title="1010. Wave 3D Logo &amp; Text"></a>1010.

We put it last on this list, but it’s actually quite a strong contender. One that just about anyone (for just about any type of project they’re working on), should be able to get some use out of.</p>

<h2 id="Part-3-The-Best-10-Amazing-3D-Text-Animation-Templates-3"><a href="#Part-3-The-Best-10-Amazing-3D-Text-Animation-Templates-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 The Best 10 Amazing 3D Text Animation Templates"></a>Part 3 <strong>The Best 10 Amazing 3D Text Animation Templates</strong></h2><p>Now, as promised, we’re also going to be introducing a couple of <strong>3D text animation</strong> templates that you can try out for your own projects! Each template will have a link that you can go to in order to see what it looks like, as well as an explanation on how you can use it for your projects in the future!</p>
<h3 id="01Real-3D-Light-Bulb-Kit-3"><a href="#01Real-3D-Light-Bulb-Kit-3" class="headerlink" title="01Real 3D Light Bulb Kit"></a>01Real 3D Light Bulb Kit</h3><p>The first Text Animation Template on our list is the “Logo Light Bulb” 3D Animation from Envato Elements. This one literally glows people! Making it perfect for a quirky, and yet still very impressive Title Card or Logo. Its design is very realistic, and you can also control how it flickers! For example, turning the bulbs on certain characters first, or turning them all off at once in the end.</p>
<h3 id="023D-Text-Reveal-3"><a href="#023D-Text-Reveal-3" class="headerlink" title="023D Text Reveal"></a>023D Text Reveal</h3><p>This next 3D Animation template is also from Envato Market. And, just like the first, it makes for quite the dramatic Title Card or Logo. With this template, your Text can literally zoom in to view while looking its best and sparkiest in High-Chrome.</p>
<h3 id="033D-Metallic-Text-Animation-3"><a href="#033D-Metallic-Text-Animation-3" class="headerlink" title="033D Metallic Text Animation"></a>033D Metallic Text Animation</h3><p>Our next pick, the 3D Metallic text animation is another great one for those who are looking for something flashy — something that gives off the impression of being impressive right from the gate. Compared to the previous text animation template, this one has a more rugged kind of appearance. Perfect for those looking to promote something more fun rather than professional.</p>
<h3 id="043D-Text-Box-Animation-Pack-3"><a href="#043D-Text-Box-Animation-Pack-3" class="headerlink" title="043D Text Box Animation Pack"></a>043D Text Box Animation Pack</h3><p>The next one is a little less ‘impressive’ — in the sense that it isn’t as in your face as the other 3D animation templates that we’ve introduced thus far. And that’s exactly why the 3D Text Box Animation Pack deserves to be on this list! Its <strong>3D spinning text (after effects)</strong> elements are very usable — in that it can work for a variety of individuals and styles. It has a more professional look as well. Making it perfect for corporations.</p>
<h3 id="053D-Text-Logo-Boxes-3"><a href="#053D-Text-Logo-Boxes-3" class="headerlink" title="053D Text &amp; Logo Boxes"></a>053D Text &amp; Logo Boxes</h3><p>This next one, the 3D Text &amp; Logo Boxes pack is particularly perfect for 3D logos. The pack gives you several options for box size as well as text parameters. So, you can design your animated 3D Logo however you want and use it for future projects to give them even more dimension than before.</p>
<h3 id="06The-Light-Bulb-Kit-3"><a href="#06The-Light-Bulb-Kit-3" class="headerlink" title="06The Light Bulb Kit"></a>06The Light Bulb Kit</h3><p>Our next pick, which is the ‘Light Bulb Kit’ also from Envato, is very similar to the first item on our list — in that it features text lit up by lightbulbs. However, it lends an extra bit of photo-realism to it. Less sparkle and more grain — which may exactly be what you want for your new title card or logo.</p>
<h3 id="073D-Text-Templates-3"><a href="#073D-Text-Templates-3" class="headerlink" title="073D Text Templates"></a>073D Text Templates</h3><p>The 3D Text Templates is a very bright and pop-y template that is perfect for creating eye-catching promotions and advertisements. It’s very simple to use, which, again, maybe exactly what you want. Literally, the template will ask you to choose your own text and change the colors to suit that of your own brand, then you’re done!</p>
<h3 id="083D-Text-Shapes-Logo-Reveal-3"><a href="#083D-Text-Shapes-Logo-Reveal-3" class="headerlink" title="083D Text Shapes Logo Reveal"></a>083D Text Shapes Logo Reveal</h3><p>The ‘3D Text Shapes Logo Reveal’ template is a pack of 3D text animations that you can use in order to add a little spin to your logo reveals (quite literally, in some cases!) It has a lot of personality to it, and a certain tech-y or science-y feel that would make it perfect for anyone looking for something more technical.</p>
<h3 id="09Bold-Titles-3"><a href="#09Bold-Titles-3" class="headerlink" title="09Bold Titles"></a>09Bold Titles</h3><p>The ‘Bold Titles’ template is very loud and proud. But it has a bit of a retro-vibe to it as well. Making it stand out from some of the more minimalistic modern text animation styles that you see these days.</p>
<h3 id="1010-Wave-3D-Logo-Text-3"><a href="#1010-Wave-3D-Logo-Text-3" class="headerlink" title="1010. Wave 3D Logo &amp; Text"></a>1010. Wave 3D Logo &amp; Text</h3><p>Looking for something simple and professional? Then the ‘Wave 3D Logo &amp; Text’ template may just be the one for you. We put it last on this list, but it’s actually quite a strong contender. One that just about anyone (for just about any type of project they’re working on), should be able to get some use out of.</p>
<h2 id="Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-3"><a href="#Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-3" class="headerlink" title="Key Takeaways from This Episode"></a>Key Takeaways from This Episode</h2><p><strong>●</strong> 3D Text Animation is the practice of bringing text to life! It gives dimension, depth, and, even, movement into what are usually very static properties!</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You see a lot of 3D Text Animation in big pictures these days. And you can start creating your own with the use of Adobe After Effects — a VFX and Motion Graphics Software that a lot of professionals use for their own text animation.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Of course, if you don’t have the kind of time to create your own 3D Text Animations from scratch, you can always use templates instead! There are hundreds (if not thousands) of them available out there. It should be simple enough to find one that fits the kind of vibe you’re looking for.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> SECRET TIP! If you’re looking for an all-in-one kind of solution, you might want to consider Filmora Pro. It’s a video editor, first and foremost, but that’s not all it is — you can be using it today to start creating your own 3D Text Animations!</p>

<p> Microsoft Powerpoint has been on the Internet for quite some time now. People who use this application make a common mistake of using too many slides with huge amounts of text and that is a major turnoff for the audience. Huge text is seen as a disaster.

<h4 id="Method-1-Powerpoint-Picture-Insert-Utility-2"><a href="#Method-1-Powerpoint-Picture-Insert-Utility-2" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Powerpoint Picture Insert Utility"></a>Method 1: Powerpoint Picture Insert Utility</h4><p> Select the Insert tab located at the top of the Powerpoint application.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="insert gif to powerpoint"
                ></p>
<p> The next step is to select the Picture icon located in the Images ribbon area located also at the top of the computer window. Look for the image that you desire to add to the Powerpoint slide, then make sure to double click on the file to successfully insert your image.</p>
<p> You also have the option to move the GIF image on the page by clicking and dragging the image to the location that you want to place the picture.</p>
<h4 id="Method-2-Copy-and-Paste-2"><a href="#Method-2-Copy-and-Paste-2" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Copy and Paste"></a>Method 2: Copy and Paste</h4><p> A helpful step is to first locate your desired GIF image, using Control + C to copy it first.

<p> Select Pictures, then write in the image URL directly in the File input box. Then, select Insert. The Powerpoint application will download the GIF image that you selected into the current Powerpoint slide for your presentation. The GIF image is still available for you to access anytime if you are not connected to the Internet. It is due to being embedded.</p>
