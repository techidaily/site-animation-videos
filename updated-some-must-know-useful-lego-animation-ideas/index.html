It offers a full-scale editing panel and a plethora of features that allow designers to create visually enticing 3D animations for videos, games, and marketing purposes. But, can you use Blender to create 2D animations? Even though the tool is marketed as a 3D animation creator, it’s worth noting that one can use it for 2D animations as well. Now, the process may not be as straightforward as using a dedicated 2D animation creator, you can still get the job done using Blender. This will be pretty helpful if you are already a Blender user and want to create 2D animations for a project.</p>
<p>To help you along the way, we have put together a detailed guide on how to create Blender 2D animations and use them in your videos to make them look more stunning. So, without any further ado, let’s get started.</p>

Its worldwide popularity is clear proof of what one can achieve while creating a 3D animation with Blender. But, the real question is - are Blender 2D animations as good as their 3D alternatives. Well, the answer is Yes! Blender has a built-in feature known as Grease Pencil that’s specifically designed to create 2D animations. With Grease Pencil, you can create different 2D layouts from scratch and turn them into visually appealing animations to engage the potential viewers.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Mix-2D-3D-Animation-in-Blender"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Mix-2D-3D-Animation-in-Blender" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How to Mix 2D &amp; 3D Animation in Blender?"></a>Part 2 How to Mix 2D &amp; 3D Animation in Blender?</h2><p>So, how can you create 2D animations in Blender? Well, it depends! The process to create a 2D animation in Blender mainly depends on what you want to design. You can find different Blender 2D animation tutorials on YouTube and use them to get started with 2D animations in Blender. But, we would like to point out that there’s a generic process that’ll remain consistent in every situation. If you are also getting started with creating 2D animations in Blender, here’s the step-by-step process that’ll help you start sailing in the right direction and make the 2D animation designing a hassle-free task.</p>
<h5 id="Step-1"><a href="#Step-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 1"></a>Step 1</h5><p>First and foremost, launch Blender on your system and set it up to get started. On the home screen, click on “File&gt;New” and then, select “2D Animation”.</p>

                ></p>
<h5 id="Step-2"><a href="#Step-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 2"></a>Step 2</h5><p>Now, click on the Grease Pencil tool and use it to draw any shape on the canvas. If you want to add multiple objects to the animation, you can also draw multiple shapes.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="design image blender"
                ></p>
<h5 id="Step-3"><a href="#Step-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 3"></a>Step 3</h5><p>The next step would be to apply the array modifier to these shapes, considering you want to add a specific movement to them. So, add an array modifier first and then apply it over the desired shapes.</p>
<h5 id="Step-4"><a href="#Step-4" class="headerlink" title="Step 4"></a>Step 4</h5><p>After you have applied the array modifier, go ahead and start adding colors to the animation. Keep in mind the more colors you use, the better the Blender 2D animation will appear at the end.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<h5 id="Step-5"><a href="#Step-5" class="headerlink" title="Step 5"></a>Step 5</h5><p>Now, through the editing panel, right-click on the shape you’ve drawn on the screen and then, select “Rotation and Scale”. A separate editing window will pop up on your screen. Here you can customize the movement of the object by changing its scaling options through keyframing.</p>
<p>That’s it; your 2D animation is now ready and you can save it on your computer.</p>

                      alt="Wondershare Filmora Animated Slideshow Creator- Media Import Interface"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Timeline Positioning of Media Files</strong></p>
<p>Before working on the task of positioning the imported media files on the app’s timeline, navigate to the ‘File’ menu and choose the ‘Preferences’ option. As soon as the respective window pops up, reach to the ‘Editing’ tab at the top and select ‘Photo Placement’ from the drop down menu that follows.</p>
<p>In case your selected images do not have a matching aspect ratio with the program’s preset values, choose the ‘Crop to Fit’ option for removing the additional black bars from the selected images. For the requirement of adding camera pan and zoom movements to your images, select the ‘Pan &amp; Zoom’ option in the ‘Preferences’ settings.</p>
<p><img

                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p>You can proceed to change the preset play durations of images, effects and transitions in the ‘Editing’ window itself. As an alternative you can adhere to the same task in the program’s timeline by dragging any one end of the media files in an outward or inward direction. The ‘Crop to Fit’ option may not give an affordable size in some cases where the images are set in a vertical 9:16 aspect ratio. Choose the ‘Fit’ option to set this issue straight.</p>

Continue repeating the process till all the images have been placed at their respective locations, and in the exact order of appearance in the slideshow. This should be followed by adjusting the image play durations using any one of the previously described methods.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Escape Hard Cuts With Image Transitions</strong></p>
<p>Hard cuts among different slides of a presentation break the flow of the slideshow. To escape this cringe, consider using a smooth transition effect within the slides of your project. To do this, navigate to the ‘Transitions’ tab in the top toolbar of Filmora’s project window and select a desired one from over 100 choices of customizable transitions.</p>
<p>You can now drop these transitions in the timeline at the exact intersection point of two image files. Avoid using the same transition for every hard cut to escape monotony. You can instead choose different transitions for each slide while observing its appearance in the clip.</p>
<p>After you are done with applying transitions to each slide, double click on a particular transition to open its ‘Transition Setting Window’ either for presetting the transition play duration or to choose a desired transition mode. You can also prefer a direct customization of the transition duration in the project timeline through a right or left dragging of any of its ends.</p>

<p>To apply these effects, just select and add them into a timeline track above the clip you wish to add the overlay or filter to. When you have applied the effects, observe the overall clip appearance in the ‘Preview Panel’. Double click on a particular effect to fine-tune the latter’s settings.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 6: Supplement Your Slides With Motion Graphic Elements</strong></p>
<p>While motion graphics will undoubtedly enhance your animated slideshows, adding them to your presentation is purely optional, since most professional projects do not need a motion graphic element to escalate their presentation outlook. If, however, you choose to work on making these a part of your animated slideshow, Filmora lets you do that in its ‘Elements’ tab.</p>
<p>There is a plethora of motion graphic templates that you can select and add to the project timeline for a quick and vibrant upgrade of your presentation slides, but, at the same time, it becomes important to take care of the visual outlook and the underlying reason of creating the slideshow before you decide on adding these elements to your project.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 7: Create Voiceovers and Record Soundtracks for Your Slideshow</strong></p>
<p>Narration is a smart way to captivate the target audience within your slideshow, whether though a self-delivery or a recorded voiceover. If you decide on the second option, you can conveniently use the Filmora Slideshow Creator program to add voiceovers and soundtracks to your presentation.</p>

You can use the app for free but for faster editing and an ad free experience, you will need to upgrade to the paid version. Other than just creating a cartoon of yourself, you can also create renaissance portraits and caricatures.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Step 1: Download the Voila AI artist App for your device, and complete the installation process. Allow the app to access your Phone’s Camera rolling permission.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Step 2: Select the style option you want to use. What we are using here is 3D cartoon (other options: 2D Cartoon, Caricature &amp; and the rest). Touch the arrow and start.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Step 3: Now, with your camera roll open, click a new one or choose from your gallery. You can also find a <strong>celebrities</strong> option where you can search for celebrities. This generates a four-grid choice. If you are using the free version, then be prepared to encounter one or two ads. After a few seconds, you can exit out and get back to your images.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Step 4: You will receive a composite grid of four options; your original image, plus three cartoon representations (Royalty 3D, Baby 3D &amp; Cartoon 3D). Here, you can select the option you like the most and start editing. Locate the up arrow button to immediately share on your preferred social media or simply save a copy in your device.</p>

<p>The process behind creating a <strong>3D cartoon of yourself</strong> for Meta platforms starts by establishing a facial rig which is like a framework for the cartoon animations to sit on.

<p>The Voila AI artist app can be downloaded from the Apple App store and Android Play Store. You can use the app for free but for faster editing and an ad free experience, you will need to upgrade to the paid version. Other than just creating a cartoon of yourself, you can also create renaissance portraits and caricatures.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Step 1: Download the Voila AI artist App for your device, and complete the installation process. Allow the app to access your Phone’s Camera rolling permission.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Step 2: Select the style option you want to use. What we are using here is 3D cartoon (other options: 2D Cartoon, Caricature &amp; and the rest). Touch the arrow and start.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Step 3: Now, with your camera roll open, click a new one or choose from your gallery. You can also find a <strong>celebrities</strong> option where you can search for celebrities. This generates a four-grid choice. If you are using the free version, then be prepared to encounter one or two ads. After a few seconds, you can exit out and get back to your images.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Step 4: You will receive a composite grid of four options; your original image, plus three cartoon representations (Royalty 3D, Baby 3D &amp; Cartoon 3D). Here, you can select the option you like the most and start editing. Locate the up arrow button to immediately share on your preferred social media or simply save a copy in your device.</p>

<p>The process behind creating a <strong>3D cartoon of yourself</strong> for Meta platforms starts by establishing a facial rig which is like a framework for the cartoon animations to sit on.

<p>Note; These steps are to be perceived as a simplified overview of your objectives when editing on Photoshop;</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> To start out on turning your image into a 3D character, you need to learn how to create layers and then stack them on each other.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can then ‘liquify’ these layers to form a mould for your image.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Apply skin softening techniques to take away the realistic features of the photo before working on turning it into a cartoon.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Now you can start focus on applying the details to features like eyes, hair, nose and facial lines on your cartoon image.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can also change the colour of any individual features on your image. This method is applicable in making caricatures of your photo as well.</p>

<p>The Voila AI artist app can be downloaded from the Apple App store and Android Play Store. You can use the app for free but for faster editing and an ad free experience, you will need to upgrade to the paid version. Other than just creating a cartoon of yourself, you can also create renaissance portraits and caricatures.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Step 1: Download the Voila AI artist App for your device, and complete the installation process. Allow the app to access your Phone’s Camera rolling permission.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Step 2: Select the style option you want to use. What we are using here is 3D cartoon (other options: 2D Cartoon, Caricature &amp; and the rest). Touch the arrow and start.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Step 3: Now, with your camera roll open, click a new one or choose from your gallery. You can also find a <strong>celebrities</strong> option where you can search for celebrities. This generates a four-grid choice. If you are using the free version, then be prepared to encounter one or two ads. After a few seconds, you can exit out and get back to your images.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Step 4: You will receive a composite grid of four options; your original image, plus three cartoon representations (Royalty 3D, Baby 3D &amp; Cartoon 3D). Here, you can select the option you like the most and start editing. Locate the up arrow button to immediately share on your preferred social media or simply save a copy in your device.</p>
<p>If the AI artist app has any paid and premium version, upon subscribing you will get ad free &amp; watermark free animated representations.</p>

It can be done using color table tool that assists in easy selection and de-selection. This table use to contain about 256 unique colours and all of them use to contain 8 bit wide information. The best recommendation for good quality and small seize GIFs is to limit colours up to 64 only or keep then less than this. But sometimes your original videos may ask you for increment in color information.</p>

If you are interested to know about various resizing concepts related to GIFs then the article below can be helpful for you.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-reduce-GIF-size-3"><a href="#How-to-reduce-GIF-size-3" class="headerlink" title="How to reduce GIF size?"></a>How to reduce GIF size?</h2><p>There are so many things that contribute in managing overall size of GIFs. The list includes the colour count inside, dimensions of images that you have used for development of GIFs and number of frames included inside one GIF folder. In case if it is an animated GIF then size may increase accordingly. Somehow, if you become able to optimize your Gifs then it is much easier to share them over internet.</p>
<p>Photoshop is a great tool to edit your image, including gif images. Here we are going to show you how to make your GIF smaller in Photoshop.</p>

<p>The very first task for users is to bring your GIF video file onto Photoshop timeline. Sometimes, it is not essential to update whole series of your GIF animation to the library, the GIF can be simply trimmed at timeline panel. One needs to turn on loop option and then be active enough to allocate the right place to trim your video.</p>
<p> <strong>2. Reduce dimensions of Output:</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<p>Those who are working on Photoshop CC 2017 version will be able to develop GIFs by simply executing Explore As option from menu. To do this, they need to move to files and then from drop down menu select Export as. Soon a menu will open where you need to choose your output file format as GIF and adjust weight and height parameter to reduce physical dimensions of your image.</p>
<p>In case if you are using Adobe Photoshop Elements 14 then on its interface, users need to move to File and then hit Save for Web option. It will help to open a Save for Web type dialogue box immediately, on this new window you can apply desired changes to physical dimensions of your content, reduce color information and apply dithering etc.</p>
<p> <strong>3. Adjust number of colors in image:</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<p>One of the most useful tricks for marketers is to optimize size of their GIF images by adjusting total number of colours to it. It can be done using color table tool that assists in easy selection and de-selection. This table use to contain about 256 unique colours and all of them use to contain 8 bit wide information. The best recommendation for good quality and small seize GIFs is to limit colours up to 64 only or keep then less than this. But sometimes your original videos may ask you for increment in color information.</p>
<p> <strong>Tips:</strong></p>
<p>During GIF size reduction process, you will have to go through color number selections in the series of 256, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1 etc. Use the smaller side of scale to get best results during optimization process.</p>
<ul>
<li>Users can also reduce number of frames in their GIFs.</li>
<li>Never forget to avoid dithering as it may help to improve appearance of images.</li>
<li>It is essential work with loss less compression algorithms otherwise huge loss in information will be carried out.</li>
<li>Interlacing is not good option for your GIFs as it causes significant increase in overall file size.</li>

<h2 id="Part-1-Why-Custom-Whiteboard-Animation-Videos-Work-3"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Custom-Whiteboard-Animation-Videos-Work-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Why Custom Whiteboard Animation Videos Work"></a>Part 1 Why Custom Whiteboard Animation Videos Work</h2><p>The whiteboard animation video is an explainer video used to sell a product or describe a system. These animation videos are incredibly effective in communicating complex ideas and boosting attention and retention for your audience. A custom whiteboard animation video is a do-it-yourself video that does not require a template, but you need to start from scratch. Here are top reasons why you need a custom whiteboard animation video to work:</p>
<p><img

                      alt="custom whiteboard animation"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> When you want to describe a complex, highly technical, or intricate idea, product, or system, a custom whiteboard animated video will help you out. The more detailed an explanation is, the harder it is to focus, and people often get bored during the description. Therefore, sharing a new business process with a custom whiteboard animation with your team is more manageable. Getting your point across will maintain our interest as long as the video is playing.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> A custom whiteboard animation saves you the stress of hiring actors to play in your video and turn, saves costs and serious embarrassment by actors.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Custom whiteboard animation videos are helpful when you want to use social media ads or YouTube for marketing as people like them, so, therefore, it is a good chance for you to get clicks, views, and more sales.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> A custom whiteboard animation helps you to tell the story of your brand.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It helps to reuse old audio content lying around, for example, podcast episodes. You can create pre-existing audio with a custom whiteboard animation that will help you capitalize on content that has already been created and breathe in new life.</p>

These whiteboard animated videos are tactically created to help you sell your services and products, improve internal communication, educate your customers, provide better user engagement, and convey complex or essential ideas.

                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> When you work with a professional and reputable team, the process is smooth, and the final product created is more valuable.</p>
