Most importantly, if your brand shifts its audience genre, animations can also be created in the genre that you are choosing to serve at present.

<h3 id="02-Easily-informative-3"><a href="#02-Easily-informative-3" class="headerlink" title="02 Easily informative"></a>02 Easily informative</h3><p>The motive for marketing is to inform the audience and other people about different information about your brand or company. Often, conveying information about your brands, services, and products becomes uninteresting for the audience. To make it more appealing, animated graphics can do the perfect job. They are fascinating to watch and deliver all the required information in a new and novel way. This does not bore the audience. Instead, if the animations are unique and exciting, people can actually be interested in watching them at will.</p>

And it is not just about the needs; it can be based on the audience genre you have. For example, if your products or services are meant for the kids, the animation will be made according to those factors that appeal to the kids. If your brand is for senior citizens, the animations will be different. Most importantly, if your brand shifts its audience genre, animations can also be created in the genre that you are choosing to serve at present. Thus, the customization ability of graphics animation offers flexibility in marketing.</p>

<p>Animation is one such aspect that is formed from the integration of several varied factors and processes. One of the most vital ones is the process of rigging. Thus, we will be discussing <strong>Unity character rigging</strong> as Unity is one of the most efficient platforms for animation.</p>
<p>Additionally, we will introduce you to one of the best tools you can use to edit videos and nurture the creative skills you carry in yourself. So, without any further delay, let us start our discussion.</p>
<h4 id="In-this-article-4"><a href="#In-this-article-4" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 [What is Unity Rigging?](#Part 1)</p>
<p>02 [Is It Better to Rig in Unity or Blender?](#Part 2)</p>
<p>03 [How To Use Animation Rigging In Unity](#Part 3)</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Unity-Rigging"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Unity-Rigging" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is Unity Rigging?"></a>Part 1 What is Unity Rigging?</h2><p>To understand what <strong>Unity rigging</strong> is, we must start our discussion first by discussing rigging in animation. In animation, rigging is the process in which your animation characters are separated into two parts. One is the mesh-like structure of the characters. And the other is the skeletal structure given to the characters.</p>
<p>You integrate bones and joints and join them accordingly in the characters present in your animation. It is similar to the presence of the human skeletal system. Moreover, just like the skeletal system in humans helps in the movements of the different parts of the body, the bone and joint structure through rigging also enables the characters in animation to move.</p>
<p>Therefore, we can say that rigging is the process by which you can enable your characters’ in animation to move and show different facial expressions, etc. So, it is obvious that without the process of rigging, the animation is impossible, which makes rigging one of the most crucial aspects of animation.</p>
<p>Now that we know what rigging in animation is, we will be discussing what is <strong>animation rigging in Unity</strong>. Unity technologies have developed a cross-platform gaming engine called ‘Unity’. And this platform also offers the ones interested in animation to learn animation rigging.</p>
<p>The Unity platform offers robust and effective tools for animation rigging. And these tools assist the animators to create real-time rigs in Unity. Most commonly, the set of tools in Unity for rigging is used on the characters. But, if one likes, they can also use the tools on ani Game Object that includes animations and skeletons.</p>
<p>Therefore, when you utilise the platform of Unity or the toolsets of Unity to perform rigging in animation, it can be referred to as <strong>unity rigging</strong>. It is one of the most powerful and renowned platforms for animation, creating the finest and most professional animation creations.</p>

A common question arises as to whether one should choose <strong>blender rigging over Unity</strong> or vice versa. We have laid down the following table to compare the different features of Blender with that of Unity.</p>
<p>| |  Unity            | Blender                                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                         |<br>| ——————- | ————————————————————————————————————————- | ————————————————————————————————————————————— |<br>| <strong>About</strong>           | It is a game engine that enables you in creating human-machine interfaces, AR simulations, customize splash screens, etc. | It is a computer graphics software that is open source and is mainly used for creating 3D models.                                       |<br>| <strong>Types Supported</strong> | Supports 3D                                                                                                               |                                                                                                                                         |<br>| <strong>Best Purpose</strong>    | Ideal for film, architecture, automotive, transportation, and other industries                                            | Ideal for animation and design that assists in VFX, simulation, organizations of all sizes with rendering, modeling, and video editing. |</p>
<p>There are many features that Blender lacks, but Unity includes. The features included in Unity but are absent in Blender are as follows.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Drawing</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Games</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> In-Game Analytics</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Multi-player Gaming Network</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Player Management</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Virtual Reality</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> IT Asset Management</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Prototype Creation</p>
<p>Therefore, it is preferred to opt for <strong>Unity rigging</strong> than Blender rigging, as Blender lacks a considerable number of features.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-How-To-Use-Animation-Rigging-In-Unity"><a href="#Part-3-How-To-Use-Animation-Rigging-In-Unity" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 How To Use Animation Rigging In Unity"></a>Part 3 How To Use Animation Rigging In Unity</h2><p>Now, we will be introducing you to the different steps that will help you in <strong>unity rig animation</strong>. The following list includes the steps in the sequence that, when you deploy, will help you rig in the platform of Unity.</p>
<h5 id="Step-1Installation"><a href="#Step-1Installation" class="headerlink" title="Step 1Installation"></a>Step 1Installation</h5><p>The first step is to install the “<strong>animation rigging package” of Unity</strong>. You will get the animation rigging package in the “Package Manager”. You will be able to avail of this animation package in Unity 2019.1 and above.</p>
<p>This package offers you a library that consists of rig constraints. And this library of rig constraints enables you to create procedural motion during the runtime. And the general term used for this is called “runtime rigging”.</p>
<p>The “Asset’s Animator Root” consist of the “Rig Builder Component”, which is the source where the rigs are accumulated. The rigs here are the constraints put together in groups. With these steps you will be able to create <strong>Unity humanoid rig</strong> that will make your animation creations look the finest, most realistic and most professional.</p>

<h5 id="Step-2Rig-Builder-set-up"><a href="#Step-2Rig-Builder-set-up" class="headerlink" title="Step 2Rig Builder set-up"></a>Step 2Rig Builder set-up</h5><p>After installing the <strong>unity animation rigging package</strong>, the next step is to set up the rig builder. You will have to use the “Animator component” in this step. Using the “Animator component”, integrate the “Rig Builder component” with the “GameObject”. Generally, in the hierarchy of rig, it is the topmost “Transform”.</p>
<p>Then, you will have to make a new child GameObject. To which, you will have to integrate the “Rig component”. After this step, you need to access the “Animator root”, where you will find the “Rig Builder component”. In the “Rig Builder component”, you need to assign the “Rig to the Rig Layers” list.</p>
<p>It will complete the task of creating the most basic rig. The further steps will help you install the required behaviours in the character or characters.</p>

<h5 id="Step-3Bone-Rendering"><a href="#Step-3Bone-Rendering" class="headerlink" title="Step 3Bone Rendering"></a>Step 3Bone Rendering</h5><p>Whether it is <strong>unity rigging</strong> or 3D, bone rendering is the most crucial step to enable your animation characters to gain movement. The “Unity Editor” will help you interact and work with the character’s skeleton in the “Scene view.”</p>
<p>You can add “Transform” lists and then display them in various visual styles with the help of the “Bone Renderer: component. It enables you to integrate numerous “Bone Renderer” components, each of them having its unique style of display. As a result, gameplay debugging, rig setup, keyframing, and other artist workflows are facilitated.</p>

<h5 id="Step-5Managing-the-Rig-Constraints"><a href="#Step-5Managing-the-Rig-Constraints" class="headerlink" title="Step 5Managing the Rig Constraints"></a>Step 5Managing the Rig Constraints</h5><p>Your characters gain “runtime animation” through the rig constraints, and thus, these are the building blocks facilitating assembling the rigs. The rigs are combined in multiple and varied ways to obtain the desired motions and movements in the characters.</p>

                      alt="bind pose unity"
                ></p>
<p>Then add a child GameObject below “Character Rig”. Then add a new child GameObject below “Right Arm IK”. Integrate two new child GameObjects beneath the “Right Arm Ik” by naming the first and the second one “RH IK Target” and “RH IK Hint”, respectively.</p>
<p><img

In animation, rigging is the process in which your animation characters are separated into two parts. One is the mesh-like structure of the characters. And the other is the skeletal structure given to the characters.</p>
<p>You integrate bones and joints and join them accordingly in the characters present in your animation. It is similar to the presence of the human skeletal system. Moreover, just like the skeletal system in humans helps in the movements of the different parts of the body, the bone and joint structure through rigging also enables the characters in animation to move.</p>
<p>Therefore, we can say that rigging is the process by which you can enable your characters’ in animation to move and show different facial expressions, etc. So, it is obvious that without the process of rigging, the animation is impossible, which makes rigging one of the most crucial aspects of animation.</p>
<p>Now that we know what rigging in animation is, we will be discussing what is <strong>animation rigging in Unity</strong>. Unity technologies have developed a cross-platform gaming engine called ‘Unity’. And this platform also offers the ones interested in animation to learn animation rigging.</p>
<p>The Unity platform offers robust and effective tools for animation rigging. And these tools assist the animators to create real-time rigs in Unity. Most commonly, the set of tools in Unity for rigging is used on the characters. But, if one likes, they can also use the tools on ani Game Object that includes animations and skeletons.</p>
<p>Therefore, when you utilise the platform of Unity or the toolsets of Unity to perform rigging in animation, it can be referred to as <strong>unity rigging</strong>. It is one of the most powerful and renowned platforms for animation, creating the finest and most professional animation creations.</p>

A common question arises as to whether one should choose <strong>blender rigging over Unity</strong> or vice versa. We have laid down the following table to compare the different features of Blender with that of Unity.</p>

<p>There are many features that Blender lacks, but Unity includes. The features included in Unity but are absent in Blender are as follows.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Drawing</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Games</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> In-Game Analytics</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Multi-player Gaming Network</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Player Management</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Virtual Reality</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> IT Asset Management</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Prototype Creation</p>
<p>Therefore, it is preferred to opt for <strong>Unity rigging</strong> than Blender rigging, as Blender lacks a considerable number of features.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-How-To-Use-Animation-Rigging-In-Unity-1"><a href="#Part-3-How-To-Use-Animation-Rigging-In-Unity-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 How To Use Animation Rigging In Unity"></a>Part 3 How To Use Animation Rigging In Unity</h2><p>Now, we will be introducing you to the different steps that will help you in <strong>unity rig animation</strong>. The following list includes the steps in the sequence that, when you deploy, will help you rig in the platform of Unity.</p>
<h5 id="Step-1Installation-1"><a href="#Step-1Installation-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 1Installation"></a>Step 1Installation</h5><p>The first step is to install the “<strong>animation rigging package” of Unity</strong>. You will get the animation rigging package in the “Package Manager”. You will be able to avail of this animation package in Unity 2019.1 and above.</p>
<p>This package offers you a library that consists of rig constraints. And this library of rig constraints enables you to create procedural motion during the runtime. And the general term used for this is called “runtime rigging”.</p>
<p>The “Asset’s Animator Root” consist of the “Rig Builder Component”, which is the source where the rigs are accumulated. The rigs here are the constraints put together in groups. With these steps you will be able to create <strong>Unity humanoid rig</strong> that will make your animation creations look the finest, most realistic and most professional.</p>

<h5 id="Step-2Rig-Builder-set-up-1"><a href="#Step-2Rig-Builder-set-up-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 2Rig Builder set-up"></a>Step 2Rig Builder set-up</h5><p>After installing the <strong>unity animation rigging package</strong>, the next step is to set up the rig builder. You will have to use the “Animator component” in this step. Using the “Animator component”, integrate the “Rig Builder component” with the “GameObject”. Generally, in the hierarchy of rig, it is the topmost “Transform”.</p>
<p>Then, you will have to make a new child GameObject. To which, you will have to integrate the “Rig component”. After this step, you need to access the “Animator root”, where you will find the “Rig Builder component”. In the “Rig Builder component”, you need to assign the “Rig to the Rig Layers” list.</p>
<p>It will complete the task of creating the most basic rig. The further steps will help you install the required behaviours in the character or characters.</p>

<h5 id="Step-3Bone-Rendering-1"><a href="#Step-3Bone-Rendering-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 3Bone Rendering"></a>Step 3Bone Rendering</h5><p>Whether it is <strong>unity rigging</strong> or 3D, bone rendering is the most crucial step to enable your animation characters to gain movement. The “Unity Editor” will help you interact and work with the character’s skeleton in the “Scene view.”</p>
<p>You can add “Transform” lists and then display them in various visual styles with the help of the “Bone Renderer: component. It enables you to integrate numerous “Bone Renderer” components, each of them having its unique style of display. As a result, gameplay debugging, rig setup, keyframing, and other artist workflows are facilitated.</p>

<h5 id="Step-5Managing-the-Rig-Constraints-1"><a href="#Step-5Managing-the-Rig-Constraints-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 5Managing the Rig Constraints"></a>Step 5Managing the Rig Constraints</h5><p>Your characters gain “runtime animation” through the rig constraints, and thus, these are the building blocks facilitating assembling the rigs. The rigs are combined in multiple and varied ways to obtain the desired motions and movements in the characters.</p>

The following list includes the steps in the sequence that, when you deploy, will help you rig in the platform of Unity.</p>
<h5 id="Step-1Installation-2"><a href="#Step-1Installation-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 1Installation"></a>Step 1Installation</h5><p>The first step is to install the “<strong>animation rigging package” of Unity</strong>. You will get the animation rigging package in the “Package Manager”. You will be able to avail of this animation package in Unity 2019.1 and above.</p>
<p>This package offers you a library that consists of rig constraints. And this library of rig constraints enables you to create procedural motion during the runtime. And the general term used for this is called “runtime rigging”.</p>
<p>The “Asset’s Animator Root” consist of the “Rig Builder Component”, which is the source where the rigs are accumulated. The rigs here are the constraints put together in groups.

<h5 id="Step-2Rig-Builder-set-up-2"><a href="#Step-2Rig-Builder-set-up-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 2Rig Builder set-up"></a>Step 2Rig Builder set-up</h5><p>After installing the <strong>unity animation rigging package</strong>, the next step is to set up the rig builder. You will have to use the “Animator component” in this step. Using the “Animator component”, integrate the “Rig Builder component” with the “GameObject”. Generally, in the hierarchy of rig, it is the topmost “Transform”.</p>
<p>Then, you will have to make a new child GameObject. To which, you will have to integrate the “Rig component”. After this step, you need to access the “Animator root”, where you will find the “Rig Builder component”. In the “Rig Builder component”, you need to assign the “Rig to the Rig Layers” list.</p>
<p>It will complete the task of creating the most basic rig. The further steps will help you install the required behaviours in the character or characters.</p>

The “Unity Editor” will help you interact and work with the character’s skeleton in the “Scene view.”</p>
<p>You can add “Transform” lists and then display them in various visual styles with the help of the “Bone Renderer: component. It enables you to integrate numerous “Bone Renderer” components, each of them having its unique style of display. As a result, gameplay debugging, rig setup, keyframing, and other artist workflows are facilitated.</p>

<p>Animation is one such aspect that is formed from the integration of several varied factors and processes. One of the most vital ones is the process of rigging. Thus, we will be discussing <strong>Unity character rigging</strong> as Unity is one of the most efficient platforms for animation.</p>
<p>Additionally, we will introduce you to one of the best tools you can use to edit videos and nurture the creative skills you carry in yourself. So, without any further delay, let us start our discussion.</p>
<h4 id="In-this-article-7"><a href="#In-this-article-7" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 [What is Unity Rigging?](#Part 1)</p>
<p>02 [Is It Better to Rig in Unity or Blender?](#Part 2)</p>
<p>03 [How To Use Animation Rigging In Unity](#Part 3)</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Unity-Rigging-3"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Unity-Rigging-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is Unity Rigging?"></a>Part 1 What is Unity Rigging?</h2><p>To understand what <strong>Unity rigging</strong> is, we must start our discussion first by discussing rigging in animation. In animation, rigging is the process in which your animation characters are separated into two parts. One is the mesh-like structure of the characters. And the other is the skeletal structure given to the characters.</p>
<p>You integrate bones and joints and join them accordingly in the characters present in your animation. It is similar to the presence of the human skeletal system. Moreover, just like the skeletal system in humans helps in the movements of the different parts of the body, the bone and joint structure through rigging also enables the characters in animation to move.</p>
<p>Therefore, we can say that rigging is the process by which you can enable your characters’ in animation to move and show different facial expressions, etc. So, it is obvious that without the process of rigging, the animation is impossible, which makes rigging one of the most crucial aspects of animation.</p>
<p>Now that we know what rigging in animation is, we will be discussing what is <strong>animation rigging in Unity</strong>. Unity technologies have developed a cross-platform gaming engine called ‘Unity’. And this platform also offers the ones interested in animation to learn animation rigging.</p>
<p>The Unity platform offers robust and effective tools for animation rigging. And these tools assist the animators to create real-time rigs in Unity. Most commonly, the set of tools in Unity for rigging is used on the characters. But, if one likes, they can also use the tools on ani Game Object that includes animations and skeletons.</p>
<p>Therefore, when you utilise the platform of Unity or the toolsets of Unity to perform rigging in animation, it can be referred to as <strong>unity rigging</strong>. It is one of the most powerful and renowned platforms for animation, creating the finest and most professional animation creations.</p>

After this step, you need to access the “Animator root”, where you will find the “Rig Builder component”. In the “Rig Builder component”, you need to assign the “Rig to the Rig Layers” list.</p>
<p>It will complete the task of creating the most basic rig. The further steps will help you install the required behaviours in the character or characters.</p>

<h5 id="Step-3Bone-Rendering-3"><a href="#Step-3Bone-Rendering-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 3Bone Rendering"></a>Step 3Bone Rendering</h5><p>Whether it is <strong>unity rigging</strong> or 3D, bone rendering is the most crucial step to enable your animation characters to gain movement. The “Unity Editor” will help you interact and work with the character’s skeleton in the “Scene view.”</p>
<p>You can add “Transform” lists and then display them in various visual styles with the help of the “Bone Renderer: component. It enables you to integrate numerous “Bone Renderer” components, each of them having its unique style of display. As a result, gameplay debugging, rig setup, keyframing, and other artist workflows are facilitated.</p>

                      alt="bind pose unity"
                ></p>
<p>Then add a child GameObject below “Character Rig”. Then add a new child GameObject below “Right Arm IK”. Integrate two new child GameObjects beneath the “Right Arm Ik” by naming the first and the second one “RH IK Target” and “RH IK Hint”, respectively.</p>
<p><img

<p>Are you looking for some interesting and animated GIF icons? Then simply read this guide to discover funny GIF icons and learn how to create them on your own.</p>
<p>GIF, which stands for Graphics Interchange Format, has now become extremely popular among social media. From sending our reactions to something to wishing others on special occasions, GIFs can be used in so many ways. Though, there are times when we would like to use animated GIF icons in your designs to make them more appealing. Therefore, in this post, I will let you know how to create some funny GIF icons and would also share a few resources to find readily available GIF icons.</p>
<p><img

<h2 id="Part-1-Smart-Ways-to-Create-Your-Own-Animated-GIF-Icons"><a href="#Part-1-Smart-Ways-to-Create-Your-Own-Animated-GIF-Icons" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Smart Ways to Create Your Own Animated GIF Icons"></a>Part 1 Smart Ways to Create Your Own Animated GIF Icons</h2><p>While there are so many ways to come up with animated GIF icons, I would recommend exploring the following options:</p>
<h3 id="Method-1-Use-Adobe-Photoshop-to-Create-GIF-Icons"><a href="#Method-1-Use-Adobe-Photoshop-to-Create-GIF-Icons" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Use Adobe Photoshop to Create GIF Icons"></a>Method 1: Use Adobe Photoshop to Create GIF Icons</h3><p>If you are looking for a professional solution to create a live GIF icon, then I would recommend using Adobe Photoshop. While the application is not that easy to use, it will be an ideal long-term solution. In nutshell, you can create animated GIF icons by loading assets, duplicating layers, and then merging them in the following way:</p>
<h5 id="Step-1-Load-Assets-on-Photoshop"><a href="#Step-1-Load-Assets-on-Photoshop" class="headerlink" title="Step 1 Load Assets on Photoshop"></a>Step 1 Load Assets on Photoshop</h5><p>At first, you can simply launch Adobe Photoshop on your system and go to its File &gt; Scripts to load media assets into your stack.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-2.jpg"
                      alt="photoshop load script"
                ></p>
<p>This will let you browse and load the media assets to your projects. In case you don’t have a layer created, then you can just go to its File &gt; Layer and create a new layer.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-3.jpg"
                      alt="photoshop add layers"
                ></p>
<p>You can now rename your layers and can go to its File &gt; Window &gt; Timeline to get a timeline view of the added assets.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-4.jpg"
                      alt="photoshop view timeline"
                ></p>
<h5 id="Step-2-Work-on-the-Video-Timeline-to-Create-a-GIF"><a href="#Step-2-Work-on-the-Video-Timeline-to-Create-a-GIF" class="headerlink" title="Step 2 Work on the Video Timeline to Create a GIF"></a>Step 2 Work on the Video Timeline to Create a GIF</h5><p>Great! Once you have got the timeline view on the application, you can click on its dropdown menu and choose to create a frame animation.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-5.jpg"
                      alt="photoshop create frame animation"
                ></p>
<p>Afterward, you can select the added media and go to its Properties menu on the sidebar. From here, you can choose to create a new layer for each frame and then make frames from each layer.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-6.jpg"
                      alt="photoshop make frames"
                ></p>
<p>This will create multiple frames on the timeline at the bottom. You can edit each frame on the timeline and can also set up its preferred duration.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-7.jpg"
                      alt="photoshop adjust duration"
                ></p>
<p>You can also right-click the frames and select how many times your loading icon GIF would be repeated.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="photoshop video repeat"
                ></p>

<h3 id="Method-1-Use-Adobe-Photoshop-to-Create-GIF-Icons-1"><a href="#Method-1-Use-Adobe-Photoshop-to-Create-GIF-Icons-1" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Use Adobe Photoshop to Create GIF Icons"></a>Method 1: Use Adobe Photoshop to Create GIF Icons</h3><p>If you are looking for a professional solution to create a live GIF icon, then I would recommend using Adobe Photoshop. While the application is not that easy to use, it will be an ideal long-term solution. In nutshell, you can create animated GIF icons by loading assets, duplicating layers, and then merging them in the following way:</p>
<h5 id="Step-1-Load-Assets-on-Photoshop-1"><a href="#Step-1-Load-Assets-on-Photoshop-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 1 Load Assets on Photoshop"></a>Step 1 Load Assets on Photoshop</h5><p>At first, you can simply launch Adobe Photoshop on your system and go to its File &gt; Scripts to load media assets into your stack.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-2.jpg"
                      alt="photoshop load script"
                ></p>
<p>This will let you browse and load the media assets to your projects. In case you don’t have a layer created, then you can just go to its File &gt; Layer and create a new layer.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-3.jpg"
                      alt="photoshop add layers"
                ></p>
<p>You can now rename your layers and can go to its File &gt; Window &gt; Timeline to get a timeline view of the added assets.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-4.jpg"
                      alt="photoshop view timeline"
                ></p>
<h5 id="Step-2-Work-on-the-Video-Timeline-to-Create-a-GIF-1"><a href="#Step-2-Work-on-the-Video-Timeline-to-Create-a-GIF-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 2 Work on the Video Timeline to Create a GIF"></a>Step 2 Work on the Video Timeline to Create a GIF</h5><p>Great! Once you have got the timeline view on the application, you can click on its dropdown menu and choose to create a frame animation.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-5.jpg"
                      alt="photoshop create frame animation"
                ></p>
<p>Afterward, you can select the added media and go to its Properties menu on the sidebar. From here, you can choose to create a new layer for each frame and then make frames from each layer.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="photoshop make frames"
                ></p>
<p>This will create multiple frames on the timeline at the bottom. You can edit each frame on the timeline and can also set up its preferred duration.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="photoshop adjust duration"
                ></p>
<p>You can also right-click the frames and select how many times your loading icon GIF would be repeated.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="photoshop video repeat"

<h3 id="Method-1-Use-Adobe-Photoshop-to-Create-GIF-Icons-2"><a href="#Method-1-Use-Adobe-Photoshop-to-Create-GIF-Icons-2" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Use Adobe Photoshop to Create GIF Icons"></a>Method 1: Use Adobe Photoshop to Create GIF Icons</h3><p>If you are looking for a professional solution to create a live GIF icon, then I would recommend using Adobe Photoshop. While the application is not that easy to use, it will be an ideal long-term solution. In nutshell, you can create animated GIF icons by loading assets, duplicating layers, and then merging them in the following way:</p>
<h5 id="Step-1-Load-Assets-on-Photoshop-2"><a href="#Step-1-Load-Assets-on-Photoshop-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 1 Load Assets on Photoshop"></a>Step 1 Load Assets on Photoshop</h5><p>At first, you can simply launch Adobe Photoshop on your system and go to its File &gt; Scripts to load media assets into your stack.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-2.jpg"
                      alt="photoshop load script"
                ></p>
<p>This will let you browse and load the media assets to your projects. In case you don’t have a layer created, then you can just go to its File &gt; Layer and create a new layer.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-3.jpg"
                      alt="photoshop add layers"
                ></p>
<p>You can now rename your layers and can go to its File &gt; Window &gt; Timeline to get a timeline view of the added assets.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-4.jpg"
                      alt="photoshop view timeline"
                ></p>
<h5 id="Step-2-Work-on-the-Video-Timeline-to-Create-a-GIF-2"><a href="#Step-2-Work-on-the-Video-Timeline-to-Create-a-GIF-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 2 Work on the Video Timeline to Create a GIF"></a>Step 2 Work on the Video Timeline to Create a GIF</h5><p>Great! Once you have got the timeline view on the application, you can click on its dropdown menu and choose to create a frame animation.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-5.jpg"
                      alt="photoshop create frame animation"
                ></p>
<p>Afterward, you can select the added media and go to its Properties menu on the sidebar. From here, you can choose to create a new layer for each frame and then make frames from each layer.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="photoshop make frames"
                ></p>
<p>This will create multiple frames on the timeline at the bottom. You can edit each frame on the timeline and can also set up its preferred duration.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="photoshop adjust duration"
                ></p>
<p>You can also right-click the frames and select how many times your loading icon GIF would be repeated.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="photoshop video repeat"

<h3 id="Method-1-Use-Adobe-Photoshop-to-Create-GIF-Icons-3"><a href="#Method-1-Use-Adobe-Photoshop-to-Create-GIF-Icons-3" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Use Adobe Photoshop to Create GIF Icons"></a>Method 1: Use Adobe Photoshop to Create GIF Icons</h3><p>If you are looking for a professional solution to create a live GIF icon, then I would recommend using Adobe Photoshop. While the application is not that easy to use, it will be an ideal long-term solution. In nutshell, you can create animated GIF icons by loading assets, duplicating layers, and then merging them in the following way:</p>
<h5 id="Step-1-Load-Assets-on-Photoshop-3"><a href="#Step-1-Load-Assets-on-Photoshop-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 1 Load Assets on Photoshop"></a>Step 1 Load Assets on Photoshop</h5><p>At first, you can simply launch Adobe Photoshop on your system and go to its File &gt; Scripts to load media assets into your stack.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-2.jpg"
                      alt="photoshop load script"
                ></p>
<p>This will let you browse and load the media assets to your projects. In case you don’t have a layer created, then you can just go to its File &gt; Layer and create a new layer.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-3.jpg"
                      alt="photoshop add layers"
                ></p>
<p>You can now rename your layers and can go to its File &gt; Window &gt; Timeline to get a timeline view of the added assets.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-4.jpg"
                      alt="photoshop view timeline"
                ></p>
<h5 id="Step-2-Work-on-the-Video-Timeline-to-Create-a-GIF-3"><a href="#Step-2-Work-on-the-Video-Timeline-to-Create-a-GIF-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 2 Work on the Video Timeline to Create a GIF"></a>Step 2 Work on the Video Timeline to Create a GIF</h5><p>Great! Once you have got the timeline view on the application, you can click on its dropdown menu and choose to create a frame animation.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-5.jpg"
                      alt="photoshop create frame animation"
                ></p>
<p>Afterward, you can select the added media and go to its Properties menu on the sidebar. From here, you can choose to create a new layer for each frame and then make frames from each layer.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="photoshop make frames"
                ></p>
<p>This will create multiple frames on the timeline at the bottom. You can edit each frame on the timeline and can also set up its preferred duration.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="photoshop adjust duration"
                ></p>
<p>You can also right-click the frames and select how many times your loading icon GIF would be repeated.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="photoshop video repeat"

This gets started in an animation tutorial by Sara Barnes, which teaches you top tips for animating illustrations in After Effects, beginning with the basics.</p>
<p>Adobe After Effects is software for making special effects and motion graphics used in online content, video, and other presentations. It is available on both Mac OS and Windows PC. The After Effects is famous in TV and film post-production for creating animation, special effects, and video compositing.</p>
<p>Tasks made using After Effects can be helpful in videos, broadcast TV, web, kiosks, and in-store displays - a part of the Adobe Creative Cloud.</p>
<p>This software can create a cartoon character, design titles, and apply animation. Although <strong>Adobe 3D animation</strong> can do all these tasks, it is not similar to video editing software.</p>
<p>This program can apply effects after the footage has been edited or create motion graphics and animation from static objects created otherwise.</p>
<p>It is a tool for storytelling and visually making those appealing motion graphics that integrate into any medium to improve a presentation, image, story, or mood.</p>
<h3 id="01How-is-After-Effects-used"><a href="#01How-is-After-Effects-used" class="headerlink" title="01How is After Effects used?"></a>01How is After Effects used?</h3><p>The primary uses of After Effects categorize into three sections:</p>
<p><strong>Effects</strong>,</p>
<p><strong>Animation</strong>, and</p>
<p><strong>Compositing.</strong></p>
<p>The kind of animation for which After Effects is widely used is Motion Graphics, which includes making the motion of traditionally static objects such as text, logos, and other graphic elements.</p>
<p>Sometimes called visual effects (VFX), the effects are famous in video and film. For example, adding snow to a video scene, creating water or fire, making objects appear to turn into liquid are all instances of different effects - After Effects can create these visual effects from your video.</p>
<p>It also implies digital compositing, including merging multiple videos into a single product and integrating various videos via compositing.</p>
<h3 id="02Who-uses-After-Effects"><a href="#02Who-uses-After-Effects" class="headerlink" title="02Who uses After Effects?"></a>02Who uses After Effects?</h3><p>The After Effects is valuable to animators, visual artists, advertising agencies, video editors, video artists, video producers, social media professionals, motion graphics designers, UX professionals, etc. Gaining proficiency in After Effects comes in-depth from training, tutorials, and other hands-on use courses.</p>

This gets started in an animation tutorial by Sara Barnes, which teaches you top tips for animating illustrations in After Effects, beginning with the basics.</p>
<p>Adobe After Effects is software for making special effects and motion graphics used in online content, video, and other presentations. It is available on both Mac OS and Windows PC. The After Effects is famous in TV and film post-production for creating animation, special effects, and video compositing.</p>
<p>Tasks made using After Effects can be helpful in videos, broadcast TV, web, kiosks, and in-store displays - a part of the Adobe Creative Cloud.</p>
<p>This software can create a cartoon character, design titles, and apply animation. Although <strong>Adobe 3D animation</strong> can do all these tasks, it is not similar to video editing software.</p>
<p>This program can apply effects after the footage has been edited or create motion graphics and animation from static objects created otherwise.</p>
<p>It is a tool for storytelling and visually making those appealing motion graphics that integrate into any medium to improve a presentation, image, story, or mood.</p>

<p><strong>Effects</strong>,</p>
<p><strong>Animation</strong>, and</p>
<p><strong>Compositing.</strong></p>
<p>The kind of animation for which After Effects is widely used is Motion Graphics, which includes making the motion of traditionally static objects such as text, logos, and other graphic elements.</p>
<p>Sometimes called visual effects (VFX), the effects are famous in video and film. For example, adding snow to a video scene, creating water or fire, making objects appear to turn into liquid are all instances of different effects - After Effects can create these visual effects from your video.</p>
<p>It also implies digital compositing, including merging multiple videos into a single product and integrating various videos via compositing.</p>
