Adobe Animate CC, which is basically the new Adobe Flash, has also received an update recently which installed a bundle of new features to its interface, making it even more irresistible to animators.</p>
<p><strong>What’s new with Adobe Animate?</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Adobe Animate Camera</strong></p>
<p>Adding to Adobe’s line of exclusivity is its all-new Adobe Virtual Camera. Using this feature, Adobe animate users can now control their animation camera movements giving your animation videos a more realistic feel.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Vector Brushes</strong></p>
<p>Though it resembles the same functionality with Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Animate has renewed the tool with the ability to use tilt and pressure effects when drawing with a stylus or pen.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Web Fonts</strong></p>
<p>Now you can use a vast library of Adobe web fonts with Adobe Animate. These high-quality fonts are available in HTML5 canvas documents.</p>

Using Photoshop, you can easily play multiple GIF images side by side on the screen. Here are a few simple to follow steps to accomplish this task:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Import GIFs to combine</p>
<p>First of all, users need to launch Adobe Photoshop on their device and then import both GIF images to individual tabs. This task can be easily done using Drag and Drop tools. Resize both tabs so that you can view both images at a time on screen.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Save GIF with name</p>
<p>Go to the Window menu and ensure that the Timeline option is marked in the drop-down menu.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/photoshop-timeline.jpg"
                      alt="GIF combiner"
                ></p>
<p>Now open one empty file with height same as that of already imported GIF files. Save this file with any suitable name, for example Z.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/open-an-empty-file.jpg"
                      alt="GIF combiner file"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you need a transparent view of your imported GIF images then go to Layer and select New and finally hit Layer option. You can now hide its bottom layer.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Copy frames</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/copy-frames.jpg"
                      alt="copy frames in GIF combiner"
                ></p>
<p>Now move to the tab of the first GIF file and then to the timeline toolbar. On the top right corner of your screen, you will find the menu icon. Here you need to select and copy all frames.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Paste your copy</p>
<p>It is time to move to GIF Z file, move to its timeline toolbar, and then select the menu icon from the top right corner of your screen. Paste your recently copied selection over here. Never forget to choose Paste Over selection option from Pop up Dialogue Box.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Copy and paste</p>
<p>Simply repeat the process explained in Step 3 and 4 for the 2nd GIF image. After execution of these steps, your GIF Z file will be containing all layers of your imported GIF files but as you have pasted them one over another so it is important to separate their elements now.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> To make separation</p>
<p>To do this separation, go to GIF Z tab and then select layers of second GIF file and simply move them below the first GIF layer files. Users can now have a preview of both GIFs in the timeline window.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="preview gifs GIF combining maker"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Change image settings</p>
<p>After finalizing the best preview for your edited files, you can hit the file menu option and then save your project for device or web option. It will immediately open a dialogue box where users can easily specify their image quality and loop count details. Never forget to have one more preview before saving the final results.</p>

                      alt="looping counts to combine"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 8:</strong> Save your project</p>
<p>As now you are done with all the editing tasks so it is time to hit the “Save” option and then provide your destination address to the modified file. Your animated GIF file is now ready to get uploaded on the internet.</p>

Using Photoshop, you can easily play multiple GIF images side by side on the screen. Here are a few simple to follow steps to accomplish this task:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Import GIFs to combine</p>
<p>First of all, users need to launch Adobe Photoshop on their device and then import both GIF images to individual tabs. This task can be easily done using Drag and Drop tools. Resize both tabs so that you can view both images at a time on screen.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Save GIF with name</p>
<p>Go to the Window menu and ensure that the Timeline option is marked in the drop-down menu.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/photoshop-timeline.jpg"
                      alt="GIF combiner"
                ></p>
<p>Now open one empty file with height same as that of already imported GIF files. Save this file with any suitable name, for example Z.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/open-an-empty-file.jpg"
                      alt="GIF combiner file"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you need a transparent view of your imported GIF images then go to Layer and select New and finally hit Layer option. You can now hide its bottom layer.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Copy frames</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/copy-frames.jpg"
                      alt="copy frames in GIF combiner"
                ></p>
<p>Now move to the tab of the first GIF file and then to the timeline toolbar. On the top right corner of your screen, you will find the menu icon. Here you need to select and copy all frames.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Paste your copy</p>
<p>It is time to move to GIF Z file, move to its timeline toolbar, and then select the menu icon from the top right corner of your screen. Paste your recently copied selection over here. Never forget to choose Paste Over selection option from Pop up Dialogue Box.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Copy and paste</p>
<p>Simply repeat the process explained in Step 3 and 4 for the 2nd GIF image. After execution of these steps, your GIF Z file will be containing all layers of your imported GIF files but as you have pasted them one over another so it is important to separate their elements now.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> To make separation</p>
<p>To do this separation, go to GIF Z tab and then select layers of second GIF file and simply move them below the first GIF layer files. Users can now have a preview of both GIFs in the timeline window.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/preview-gifs.jpg"
                      alt="preview gifs GIF combining maker"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Change image settings</p>
<p>After finalizing the best preview for your edited files, you can hit the file menu option and then save your project for device or web option. It will immediately open a dialogue box where users can easily specify their image quality and loop count details. Never forget to have one more preview before saving the final results.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/looping-counts.jpg"
                      alt="looping counts to combine"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 8:</strong> Save your project</p>
<p>As now you are done with all the editing tasks so it is time to hit the “Save” option and then provide your destination address to the modified file. Your animated GIF file is now ready to get uploaded on the internet.</p>

Using Photoshop, you can easily play multiple GIF images side by side on the screen. Here are a few simple to follow steps to accomplish this task:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Import GIFs to combine</p>
<p>First of all, users need to launch Adobe Photoshop on their device and then import both GIF images to individual tabs. This task can be easily done using Drag and Drop tools. Resize both tabs so that you can view both images at a time on screen.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Save GIF with name</p>
<p>Go to the Window menu and ensure that the Timeline option is marked in the drop-down menu.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/photoshop-timeline.jpg"
                      alt="GIF combiner"
                ></p>
<p>Now open one empty file with height same as that of already imported GIF files. Save this file with any suitable name, for example Z.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/open-an-empty-file.jpg"
                      alt="GIF combiner file"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you need a transparent view of your imported GIF images then go to Layer and select New and finally hit Layer option. You can now hide its bottom layer.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Copy frames</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/copy-frames.jpg"
                      alt="copy frames in GIF combiner"
                ></p>
<p>Now move to the tab of the first GIF file and then to the timeline toolbar. On the top right corner of your screen, you will find the menu icon. Here you need to select and copy all frames.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Paste your copy</p>
<p>It is time to move to GIF Z file, move to its timeline toolbar, and then select the menu icon from the top right corner of your screen. Paste your recently copied selection over here. Never forget to choose Paste Over selection option from Pop up Dialogue Box.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Copy and paste</p>
<p>Simply repeat the process explained in Step 3 and 4 for the 2nd GIF image. After execution of these steps, your GIF Z file will be containing all layers of your imported GIF files but as you have pasted them one over another so it is important to separate their elements now.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> To make separation</p>
<p>To do this separation, go to GIF Z tab and then select layers of second GIF file and simply move them below the first GIF layer files. Users can now have a preview of both GIFs in the timeline window.</p>
