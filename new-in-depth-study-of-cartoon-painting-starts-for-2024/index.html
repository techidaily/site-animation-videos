<p><strong>Cartoon painting</strong> is slowly becoming popular due to its many benefits, especially <strong>easy cartoon canvas painting</strong>. For instance, it is pretty eye-grabbing, especially if your audience is children.</p>

<p>Thanks to the animation aspect, it has become relatively cheap to do advertisements with cartoons instead of real people.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-Are-Good-Cartoons-to-Draw"><a href="#Part-1-What-Are-Good-Cartoons-to-Draw" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What Are Good Cartoons to Draw?"></a>Part 1 What Are Good Cartoons to Draw?</h2><p>As far as good cartoons are concerned, expect about 5 popular types. These <strong>cartoons to draw</strong> include:</p>
<h3 id="01-Illustrative-Cartoons"><a href="#01-Illustrative-Cartoons" class="headerlink" title="01 Illustrative Cartoons"></a>01 Illustrative Cartoons</h3><p>They are the most suitable cartoons to draw when portraying particular ideas directly and simply.</p>
<p>The cartoons are primarily used in advertisements, teaching aids, and explaining stories. They also have text that explains them further.</p>
<p>It explains why they are common in school books, making them perfect for explaining content or subject.</p>
<p><img

<h3 id="02-Animated-Cartoons"><a href="#02-Animated-Cartoons" class="headerlink" title="02 Animated Cartoons"></a>02 Animated Cartoons</h3><p>It is important to note that these cartoons are drawn using computers despite looking as if they are hand-drawn. One thing that makes them stand out is that they seem to be in action and movement.</p>
<p>As much as that’s how they seem from the viewer’s perspective, that’s far from the truth. They are just drawn in series, and since the first one will differ from the second one, there is that illusion of movement created.</p>

<h3 id="03-Comic-Strips-or-Panels"><a href="#03-Comic-Strips-or-Panels" class="headerlink" title="03 Comic Strips or Panels"></a>03 Comic Strips or Panels</h3><p>In most cases, these are regular features characterized by established or known characters and usually displayed in newspapers.</p>
<p>Just like the animated cartoons, they are showcased in series to tell or illustrate a story. The series of panels have words said by the various characters.</p>
<p>The words are usually in balloons, and a single comic strip may cover a single or double page of a newspaper.</p>

<h3 id="04-Gag-Cartoons"><a href="#04-Gag-Cartoons" class="headerlink" title="04 Gag Cartoons"></a>04 Gag Cartoons</h3><p>As the name gag suggests, these cartoons revolve around jokes. These single-paneled cartoons often make fun of human beings.</p>
<p>Through overstatements, humor resonates from what is drawn. They can either serve as entertainment or point out, if not make fun of, people, especially their mistakes and faults. Besides the cartoon, expect a caption that’s often a single sentence.</p>

<h3 id="05-Editorial-or-Political-Cartoons"><a href="#05-Editorial-or-Political-Cartoons" class="headerlink" title="05 Editorial or Political Cartoons"></a>05 Editorial or Political Cartoons</h3><p>These cartoons are also made for the newspapers. Expect them to be a single drawing on an editorial page. It sheds more light on a particular newspaper’s editorial comment.</p>
<p>As much as some have captions, that’s not always the case. Just like the gag cartoons, they ridicule people, but the editorial ones focus on celebrities.</p>

So, feel encouraged because you stand a chance also to become an expert in the long run. All you need to do is take the first step. Fortunately, we are here to hold your hand as you do so. So. Without further ado, let’s get started.</p>
<h3 id="01-Cartoon-Painting-of-a-Young-Character"><a href="#01-Cartoon-Painting-of-a-Young-Character" class="headerlink" title="01 Cartoon Painting of a Young Character"></a>01 Cartoon Painting of a Young Character</h3><p><strong>These are the steps you need to follow when doing so:</strong></p>
<h5 id="Step-1Start-with-the-face"><a href="#Step-1Start-with-the-face" class="headerlink" title="Step 1Start with the face"></a>Step 1Start with the face</h5><p>The face is significant, especially when it comes to cartoon painting. It has complex as well as simple parts. For example, the face itself is pretty basic since you will need to begin with a circle.</p>
<p>After that, draw a horizontal and vertical line and ensure that they intersect in the middle.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<h5 id="Step-2Draw-the-eyes-by-drawing"><a href="#Step-2Draw-the-eyes-by-drawing" class="headerlink" title="Step 2Draw the eyes by drawing"></a>Step 2Draw the eyes by drawing</h5><p>Draw the eyes by drawing an oval and ensuring that the top side is slightly tilting to the side.</p>
<p>Do the same thing on the other side since the norm is a pair of eyes. The gap between the two should also be sensible.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Draw the eyes by drawing"
                ></p>
<h5 id="Step-3Draw-eyebrows"><a href="#Step-3Draw-eyebrows" class="headerlink" title="Step 3Draw eyebrows"></a>Step 3Draw eyebrows</h5><p>On the upper side of the eye, ensure that the lines are slightly thick. The eyebrows also need to be placed above the eyes, slightly above the thick line representing the eyelashes.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="draw eyebrows"
                ></p>
<h5 id="Step-4Draw-jaw"><a href="#Step-4Draw-jaw" class="headerlink" title="Step 4Draw jaw"></a>Step 4Draw jaw</h5><p>After that, start shaping the jaw. Keep in mind that it plays a huge role in determining whether the character will look thin or fat. Additionally, how you draw the jaw determines whether the character will be old or young and how old or young the person will look.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="draw jaw"
                ></p>
<h5 id="Step-5Draw-nose"><a href="#Step-5Draw-nose" class="headerlink" title="Step 5Draw nose"></a>Step 5Draw nose</h5><p>Design the nose and ensure that you don’t put many details. The good thing about the nose is that a tip is enough to serve the purpose. Another common approach when drawing the nose is doing so as if you are viewing it from the side.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Draw nose"
                ></p>
<h5 id="Step-6Draw-mouth"><a href="#Step-6Draw-mouth" class="headerlink" title="Step 6Draw mouth"></a>Step 6Draw mouth</h5><p>Next, draw the mouth and consider the age of your character as you do so. If it is a child, despite the gender, stick to simplicity. You should also avoid drawing the lips. Preferably, go for the good, expressive trace since it never disappoints.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/in-depth-study-of-cartoon-painting-starts-from-learning-to-draw-it-11.jpg"
                      alt="Draw mouth"
                ></p>
<h5 id="Step-7Draw-ears"><a href="#Step-7Draw-ears" class="headerlink" title="Step 7Draw ears"></a>Step 7Draw ears</h5><p>Proceed to the ears and in relation to whether the character is facing the camera or not. If your character is looking at the camera, you should see the front side view. Therefore, it won’t make sense to display the internal cavities in this case.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/in-depth-study-of-cartoon-painting-starts-from-learning-to-draw-it-12.jpg"
                      alt="Draw ears"
                ></p>
<h5 id="Step-8Draw-haircut"><a href="#Step-8Draw-haircut" class="headerlink" title="Step 8Draw haircut"></a>Step 8Draw haircut</h5><p>Proceed to the ears and in relation to whether the character is facing the camera or not. If your character is looking at the camera, you should see the front side view. Therefore, it won’t make sense to display the internal cavities in this case.</p>
<p>As scary as it may look, you need not be an expert to make the haircut look perfect. Additionally, there is no constant way of drawing the haircut, and you are at liberty to practice as much creativity as possible.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, please don’t take it lightly since it can be quite descriptive. For instance, the hair is used to tell the personality of a character. Practice makes perfect, and you better keep doing it until you get it right. Ensure that what you draw shows the age and character of the cartoons to draw as perfectly as possible.</p>
<p>So far, our focus has been on a young character. However, that’s not always the case explaining why we will look at a cartoon painting of an old character.</p>

<h5 id="Step-1Old-character-draw-a-face"><a href="#Step-1Old-character-draw-a-face" class="headerlink" title="Step 1Old character draw a face"></a>Step 1Old character draw a face</h5><p>The face is no different from that of a young character. Start with the eyes and add their pupils, eyebrows and don’t forget to add wrinkles.</p>
<p>Since the character is old compared to the previous one, ensure that the eyebrows are thick. They should occupy more space of the forehead.</p>

To achieve that, make the nose look close to the eyes</p>

That’s one common characteristic of an old character, especially male.</p>

<h5 id="Step-5Draw-hair"><a href="#Step-5Draw-hair" class="headerlink" title="Step 5Draw hair"></a>Step 5Draw hair</h5><p>When it comes to hair, bald and side hair will play the trick perfectly. The nose is no different from that of a young character.</p>

So, what do you do if you want to create a female one instead? These are some of the steps to follow as you do so.</p>
<p>The procedure is not that different. However, consider that women’s facial structures are more delicate than those of their male counterparts. Some of the things that stand out include long hair, a small nose, a thin chin, thin eyebrows, and large, expressive eyelashes. Large pupils will also do, especially if you are good at drawing.</p>

These <strong>cartoons to draw</strong> include:</p>
<h3 id="01-Illustrative-Cartoons-1"><a href="#01-Illustrative-Cartoons-1" class="headerlink" title="01 Illustrative Cartoons"></a>01 Illustrative Cartoons</h3><p>They are the most suitable cartoons to draw when portraying particular ideas directly and simply.</p>
<p>The cartoons are primarily used in advertisements, teaching aids, and explaining stories. They also have text that explains them further.</p>
<p>It explains why they are common in school books, making them perfect for explaining content or subject.</p>

<h3 id="02-Animated-Cartoons-1"><a href="#02-Animated-Cartoons-1" class="headerlink" title="02 Animated Cartoons"></a>02 Animated Cartoons</h3><p>It is important to note that these cartoons are drawn using computers despite looking as if they are hand-drawn. One thing that makes them stand out is that they seem to be in action and movement.</p>
<p>As much as that’s how they seem from the viewer’s perspective, that’s far from the truth. They are just drawn in series, and since the first one will differ from the second one, there is that illusion of movement created.</p>

<p>Just like the animated cartoons, they are showcased in series to tell or illustrate a story. The series of panels have words said by the various characters.</p>
<p>The words are usually in balloons, and a single comic strip may cover a single or double page of a newspaper.</p>

<h3 id="04-Gag-Cartoons-1"><a href="#04-Gag-Cartoons-1" class="headerlink" title="04 Gag Cartoons"></a>04 Gag Cartoons</h3><p>As the name gag suggests, these cartoons revolve around jokes. These single-paneled cartoons often make fun of human beings.</p>
<p>Through overstatements, humor resonates from what is drawn. They can either serve as entertainment or point out, if not make fun of, people, especially their mistakes and faults. Besides the cartoon, expect a caption that’s often a single sentence.</p>

Expect them to be a single drawing on an editorial page. It sheds more light on a particular newspaper’s editorial comment.</p>
<p>As much as some have captions, that’s not always the case. Just like the gag cartoons, they ridicule people, but the editorial ones focus on celebrities.</p>

So, feel encouraged because you stand a chance also to become an expert in the long run. All you need to do is take the first step. Fortunately, we are here to hold your hand as you do so. So. Without further ado, let’s get started.</p>
<h3 id="01-Cartoon-Painting-of-a-Young-Character-1"><a href="#01-Cartoon-Painting-of-a-Young-Character-1" class="headerlink" title="01 Cartoon Painting of a Young Character"></a>01 Cartoon Painting of a Young Character</h3><p><strong>These are the steps you need to follow when doing so:</strong></p>
<h5 id="Step-1Start-with-the-face-1"><a href="#Step-1Start-with-the-face-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 1Start with the face"></a>Step 1Start with the face</h5><p>The face is significant, especially when it comes to cartoon painting. It has complex as well as simple parts. For example, the face itself is pretty basic since you will need to begin with a circle.</p>
<p>After that, draw a horizontal and vertical line and ensure that they intersect in the middle.</p>

<p>Do the same thing on the other side since the norm is a pair of eyes. The gap between the two should also be sensible.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<h5 id="Step-3Draw-eyebrows-1"><a href="#Step-3Draw-eyebrows-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 3Draw eyebrows"></a>Step 3Draw eyebrows</h5><p>On the upper side of the eye, ensure that the lines are slightly thick. The eyebrows also need to be placed above the eyes, slightly above the thick line representing the eyelashes.</p>
<p><img

<h5 id="Step-4Draw-jaw-1"><a href="#Step-4Draw-jaw-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 4Draw jaw"></a>Step 4Draw jaw</h5><p>After that, start shaping the jaw. Keep in mind that it plays a huge role in determining whether the character will look thin or fat. Additionally, how you draw the jaw determines whether the character will be old or young and how old or young the person will look.</p>

<h5 id="Step-5Draw-nose-1"><a href="#Step-5Draw-nose-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 5Draw nose"></a>Step 5Draw nose</h5><p>Design the nose and ensure that you don’t put many details. The good thing about the nose is that a tip is enough to serve the purpose. Another common approach when drawing the nose is doing so as if you are viewing it from the side.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<h5 id="Step-6Draw-mouth-1"><a href="#Step-6Draw-mouth-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 6Draw mouth"></a>Step 6Draw mouth</h5><p>Next, draw the mouth and consider the age of your character as you do so. If it is a child, despite the gender, stick to simplicity. You should also avoid drawing the lips. Preferably, go for the good, expressive trace since it never disappoints.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<h5 id="Step-7Draw-ears-1"><a href="#Step-7Draw-ears-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 7Draw ears"></a>Step 7Draw ears</h5><p>Proceed to the ears and in relation to whether the character is facing the camera or not. If your character is looking at the camera, you should see the front side view. Therefore, it won’t make sense to display the internal cavities in this case.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<h5 id="Step-8Draw-haircut-1"><a href="#Step-8Draw-haircut-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 8Draw haircut"></a>Step 8Draw haircut</h5><p>Proceed to the ears and in relation to whether the character is facing the camera or not. If your character is looking at the camera, you should see the front side view. Therefore, it won’t make sense to display the internal cavities in this case.</p>
<p>As scary as it may look, you need not be an expert to make the haircut look perfect. Additionally, there is no constant way of drawing the haircut, and you are at liberty to practice as much creativity as possible.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, please don’t take it lightly since it can be quite descriptive. For instance, the hair is used to tell the personality of a character. Practice makes perfect, and you better keep doing it until you get it right. Ensure that what you draw shows the age and character of the cartoons to draw as perfectly as possible.</p>
<p>So far, our focus has been on a young character. However, that’s not always the case explaining why we will look at a cartoon painting of an old character.</p>

Start with the eyes and add their pupils, eyebrows and don’t forget to add wrinkles.</p>
<p>Since the character is old compared to the previous one, ensure that the eyebrows are thick. They should occupy more space of the forehead.</p>

So, what do you do if you want to create a female one instead? These are some of the steps to follow as you do so.</p>
<p>The procedure is not that different. However, consider that women’s facial structures are more delicate than those of their male counterparts. Some of the things that stand out include long hair, a small nose, a thin chin, thin eyebrows, and large, expressive eyelashes. Large pupils will also do, especially if you are good at drawing.</p>

<p>As much as that’s how they seem from the viewer’s perspective, that’s far from the truth. They are just drawn in series, and since the first one will differ from the second one, there is that illusion of movement created.</p>

<p>Just like the animated cartoons, they are showcased in series to tell or illustrate a story. The series of panels have words said by the various characters.</p>

<p>As much as some have captions, that’s not always the case. Just like the gag cartoons, they ridicule people, but the editorial ones focus on celebrities.</p>

So, feel encouraged because you stand a chance also to become an expert in the long run. All you need to do is take the first step. Fortunately, we are here to hold your hand as you do so. So. Without further ado, let’s get started.</p>
<h3 id="01-Cartoon-Painting-of-a-Young-Character-2"><a href="#01-Cartoon-Painting-of-a-Young-Character-2" class="headerlink" title="01 Cartoon Painting of a Young Character"></a>01 Cartoon Painting of a Young Character</h3><p><strong>These are the steps you need to follow when doing so:</strong></p>
<h5 id="Step-1Start-with-the-face-2"><a href="#Step-1Start-with-the-face-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 1Start with the face"></a>Step 1Start with the face</h5><p>The face is significant, especially when it comes to cartoon painting. It has complex as well as simple parts. For example, the face itself is pretty basic since you will need to begin with a circle.</p>
<p>After that, draw a horizontal and vertical line and ensure that they intersect in the middle.</p>

<p>Do the same thing on the other side since the norm is a pair of eyes. The gap between the two should also be sensible.</p>
<p><img

<h5 id="Step-3Draw-eyebrows-2"><a href="#Step-3Draw-eyebrows-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 3Draw eyebrows"></a>Step 3Draw eyebrows</h5><p>On the upper side of the eye, ensure that the lines are slightly thick. The eyebrows also need to be placed above the eyes, slightly above the thick line representing the eyelashes.</p>

<h5 id="Step-4Draw-jaw-2"><a href="#Step-4Draw-jaw-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 4Draw jaw"></a>Step 4Draw jaw</h5><p>After that, start shaping the jaw. Keep in mind that it plays a huge role in determining whether the character will look thin or fat. Additionally, how you draw the jaw determines whether the character will be old or young and how old or young the person will look.</p>

<h5 id="Step-5Draw-nose-2"><a href="#Step-5Draw-nose-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 5Draw nose"></a>Step 5Draw nose</h5><p>Design the nose and ensure that you don’t put many details. The good thing about the nose is that a tip is enough to serve the purpose. Another common approach when drawing the nose is doing so as if you are viewing it from the side.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<h5 id="Step-6Draw-mouth-2"><a href="#Step-6Draw-mouth-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 6Draw mouth"></a>Step 6Draw mouth</h5><p>Next, draw the mouth and consider the age of your character as you do so. If it is a child, despite the gender, stick to simplicity. You should also avoid drawing the lips. Preferably, go for the good, expressive trace since it never disappoints.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<h5 id="Step-7Draw-ears-2"><a href="#Step-7Draw-ears-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 7Draw ears"></a>Step 7Draw ears</h5><p>Proceed to the ears and in relation to whether the character is facing the camera or not. If your character is looking at the camera, you should see the front side view. Therefore, it won’t make sense to display the internal cavities in this case.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

<h5 id="Step-8Draw-haircut-2"><a href="#Step-8Draw-haircut-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 8Draw haircut"></a>Step 8Draw haircut</h5><p>Proceed to the ears and in relation to whether the character is facing the camera or not. If your character is looking at the camera, you should see the front side view. Therefore, it won’t make sense to display the internal cavities in this case.</p>
<p>As scary as it may look, you need not be an expert to make the haircut look perfect. Additionally, there is no constant way of drawing the haircut, and you are at liberty to practice as much creativity as possible.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, please don’t take it lightly since it can be quite descriptive. For instance, the hair is used to tell the personality of a character. Practice makes perfect, and you better keep doing it until you get it right. Ensure that what you draw shows the age and character of the cartoons to draw as perfectly as possible.</p>
<p>So far, our focus has been on a young character. However, that’s not always the case explaining why we will look at a cartoon painting of an old character.</p>

Start with the eyes and add their pupils, eyebrows and don’t forget to add wrinkles.</p>
<p>Since the character is old compared to the previous one, ensure that the eyebrows are thick. They should occupy more space of the forehead.</p>

So, what do you do if you want to create a female one instead? These are some of the steps to follow as you do so.</p>
<p>The procedure is not that different. However, consider that women’s facial structures are more delicate than those of their male counterparts. Some of the things that stand out include long hair, a small nose, a thin chin, thin eyebrows, and large, expressive eyelashes. Large pupils will also do, especially if you are good at drawing.</p>

Expect them to be a single drawing on an editorial page. It sheds more light on a particular newspaper’s editorial comment.</p>
<p>As much as some have captions, that’s not always the case. Just like the gag cartoons, they ridicule people, but the editorial ones focus on celebrities.</p>

So, feel encouraged because you stand a chance also to become an expert in the long run. All you need to do is take the first step. Fortunately, we are here to hold your hand as you do so. So. Without further ado, let’s get started.</p>
<h3 id="01-Cartoon-Painting-of-a-Young-Character-3"><a href="#01-Cartoon-Painting-of-a-Young-Character-3" class="headerlink" title="01 Cartoon Painting of a Young Character"></a>01 Cartoon Painting of a Young Character</h3><p><strong>These are the steps you need to follow when doing so:</strong></p>
<h5 id="Step-1Start-with-the-face-3"><a href="#Step-1Start-with-the-face-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 1Start with the face"></a>Step 1Start with the face</h5><p>The face is significant, especially when it comes to cartoon painting. It has complex as well as simple parts. For example, the face itself is pretty basic since you will need to begin with a circle.</p>
<p>After that, draw a horizontal and vertical line and ensure that they intersect in the middle.</p>

<p>Do the same thing on the other side since the norm is a pair of eyes. The gap between the two should also be sensible.</p>
<p><img

<h5 id="Step-3Draw-eyebrows-3"><a href="#Step-3Draw-eyebrows-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 3Draw eyebrows"></a>Step 3Draw eyebrows</h5><p>On the upper side of the eye, ensure that the lines are slightly thick. The eyebrows also need to be placed above the eyes, slightly above the thick line representing the eyelashes.</p>

<h5 id="Step-4Draw-jaw-3"><a href="#Step-4Draw-jaw-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 4Draw jaw"></a>Step 4Draw jaw</h5><p>After that, start shaping the jaw. Keep in mind that it plays a huge role in determining whether the character will look thin or fat. Additionally, how you draw the jaw determines whether the character will be old or young and how old or young the person will look.</p>

<h5 id="Step-5Draw-nose-3"><a href="#Step-5Draw-nose-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 5Draw nose"></a>Step 5Draw nose</h5><p>Design the nose and ensure that you don’t put many details. The good thing about the nose is that a tip is enough to serve the purpose. Another common approach when drawing the nose is doing so as if you are viewing it from the side.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

<h5 id="Step-6Draw-mouth-3"><a href="#Step-6Draw-mouth-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 6Draw mouth"></a>Step 6Draw mouth</h5><p>Next, draw the mouth and consider the age of your character as you do so. If it is a child, despite the gender, stick to simplicity. You should also avoid drawing the lips. Preferably, go for the good, expressive trace since it never disappoints.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<h5 id="Step-7Draw-ears-3"><a href="#Step-7Draw-ears-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 7Draw ears"></a>Step 7Draw ears</h5><p>Proceed to the ears and in relation to whether the character is facing the camera or not. If your character is looking at the camera, you should see the front side view. Therefore, it won’t make sense to display the internal cavities in this case.</p>
<p><img

<h5 id="Step-8Draw-haircut-3"><a href="#Step-8Draw-haircut-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 8Draw haircut"></a>Step 8Draw haircut</h5><p>Proceed to the ears and in relation to whether the character is facing the camera or not. If your character is looking at the camera, you should see the front side view. Therefore, it won’t make sense to display the internal cavities in this case.</p>
<p>As scary as it may look, you need not be an expert to make the haircut look perfect. Additionally, there is no constant way of drawing the haircut, and you are at liberty to practice as much creativity as possible.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, please don’t take it lightly since it can be quite descriptive. For instance, the hair is used to tell the personality of a character. Practice makes perfect, and you better keep doing it until you get it right. Ensure that what you draw shows the age and character of the cartoons to draw as perfectly as possible.</p>
<p>So far, our focus has been on a young character. However, that’s not always the case explaining why we will look at a cartoon painting of an old character.</p>

<p>Since the character is old compared to the previous one, ensure that the eyebrows are thick. They should occupy more space of the forehead.</p>

<p>The procedure is not that different. However, consider that women’s facial structures are more delicate than those of their male counterparts. Some of the things that stand out include long hair, a small nose, a thin chin, thin eyebrows, and large, expressive eyelashes. Large pupils will also do, especially if you are good at drawing.</p>

<h4 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h4><p>Anime shows are one of the most enjoyable forms of entertainment that are preferred both by kids and elders alike. Good animes take you to a different world where you forget about the stress and tensions of real life and have fun. Choosing an anime for Binge watching is very different than watching any anime on a regular day. As you are planning to spend a lot of time, you must be careful to choose among the best animes shows available.</p>
<p>You can record and share your favorite anime shows with your friends very easily with Filmora. While recording through Filmore video quality nor audio quality is lost and hence you enjoy the show to the fullest. Choose one of the shows we have mentioned for binge-watching and enjoy.</p>

<p>Emojis formerly reigned supreme, but GIFs and memes have since supplanted them. When you add a GIF to a conversation, it becomes more exciting. GIFs are considerably better at communicating our feelings, and they deserve credit for that. Pinterest, like other social networking sites and chat apps, enables GIFs. Pinterest is a photo-sharing website where you can find home decor ideas, recipes, fashion inspiration, DIY projects, and more.</p>
<p>Compared to a static image, adding a GIF to Pinterest conveys more information. You can make GIFs for your DIY projects or use them to display all sides of a cushion, which would typically require many images. But what if you like a GIF you found on Pinterest? What’s the best way to get it? That is what we will demonstrate here. This article will show how to <strong>download Pinterest GIFs</strong> to your computer and mobile device.</p>

Because the pictures on your board aren’t animated, you might conclude that animated GIFs don’t work on Pinterest.

You can’t do anything if Pinterest doesn’t animate a GIF.</p>

It is lip-syncing which brings life to the characters and makes them look talking. The process of lip-syncing in animations includes the dialogues and the mouth charts. The dialogues are broken into the phonetic syllables and the frames required for these syllables are then accessed.</p>
<p>Animations are moving and talking images and liveliness come from the dialogues that they speak. So, to make these talks appear real, flawless lip-syncing is very important.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Key-Factors-to-Consider-While-Lip-syncing-in-Animations-3"><a href="#Part-2-Key-Factors-to-Consider-While-Lip-syncing-in-Animations-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Key Factors to Consider While Lip-syncing in Animations"></a>Part 2 Key Factors to Consider While Lip-syncing in Animations</h2><p>To make the lip-syncing in your animation look perfect several factors need to be taken care of. Some of these important ones are enlisted below.</p>
<h3 id="01-Perfect-Match-of-the-Keyframes-3"><a href="#01-Perfect-Match-of-the-Keyframes-3" class="headerlink" title="01 Perfect Match of the Keyframes"></a>01 Perfect Match of the Keyframes</h3><p>The keyframes for the shapes of the words phrase by phrase needs to be perfect to make it look right. The right lip sync will have the correct timings from the mouth open to the mouth close.</p>
<h3 id="02-Adding-Body-Language-3"><a href="#02-Adding-Body-Language-3" class="headerlink" title="02 Adding Body Language"></a>02 Adding Body Language</h3><p>To make the characters in your animations look real and lively, adding gestures and body language will play a huge role. Moreover, lip-syncing along with facial expressions will add to the overall richness of the animations.</p>
<h3 id="03-Watch-Yourself-or-Record-Sample-Videos-3"><a href="#03-Watch-Yourself-or-Record-Sample-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="03 Watch Yourself or Record Sample Videos"></a>03 Watch Yourself or Record Sample Videos</h3><p>To get the correct lip-syncing for your animations, you can first try and practice by using a mirror or recording some trial videos. In these videos, you can speak and observe the jaw motion.</p>
<h3 id="04-Use-Blending-3"><a href="#04-Use-Blending-3" class="headerlink" title="04 Use Blending"></a>04 Use Blending</h3><p>The technique of blending can also be used where the focus is on the most important shape of the mouth rather than each syllable. These shapes can then be blended and used in different ways and combinations.</p>
<h3 id="05-Emphasize-Eyes-3"><a href="#05-Emphasize-Eyes-3" class="headerlink" title="05 Emphasize Eyes"></a>05 Emphasize Eyes</h3><p>Eyes need special focus as they can be used for expressing several emotions.

<p>Animation is one such aspect that is formed from the integration of several varied factors and processes. One of the most vital ones is the process of rigging. Thus, we will be discussing <strong>Unity character rigging</strong> as Unity is one of the most efficient platforms for animation.</p>
<p>Additionally, we will introduce you to one of the best tools you can use to edit videos and nurture the creative skills you carry in yourself. So, without any further delay, let us start our discussion.</p>
<h4 id="In-this-article-16"><a href="#In-this-article-16" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 [What is Unity Rigging?](#Part 1)</p>
<p>02 [Is It Better to Rig in Unity or Blender?](#Part 2)</p>
<p>03 [How To Use Animation Rigging In Unity](#Part 3)</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Unity-Rigging"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Unity-Rigging" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is Unity Rigging?"></a>Part 1 What is Unity Rigging?</h2><p>To understand what <strong>Unity rigging</strong> is, we must start our discussion first by discussing rigging in animation. In animation, rigging is the process in which your animation characters are separated into two parts. One is the mesh-like structure of the characters. And the other is the skeletal structure given to the characters.</p>
<p>You integrate bones and joints and join them accordingly in the characters present in your animation. It is similar to the presence of the human skeletal system. Moreover, just like the skeletal system in humans helps in the movements of the different parts of the body, the bone and joint structure through rigging also enables the characters in animation to move.</p>
<p>Therefore, we can say that rigging is the process by which you can enable your characters’ in animation to move and show different facial expressions, etc. So, it is obvious that without the process of rigging, the animation is impossible, which makes rigging one of the most crucial aspects of animation.</p>
<p>Now that we know what rigging in animation is, we will be discussing what is <strong>animation rigging in Unity</strong>. Unity technologies have developed a cross-platform gaming engine called ‘Unity’. And this platform also offers the ones interested in animation to learn animation rigging.</p>
<p>The Unity platform offers robust and effective tools for animation rigging. And these tools assist the animators to create real-time rigs in Unity. Most commonly, the set of tools in Unity for rigging is used on the characters. But, if one likes, they can also use the tools on ani Game Object that includes animations and skeletons.</p>
<p>Therefore, when you utilise the platform of Unity or the toolsets of Unity to perform rigging in animation, it can be referred to as <strong>unity rigging</strong>. It is one of the most powerful and renowned platforms for animation, creating the finest and most professional animation creations.</p>

A common question arises as to whether one should choose <strong>blender rigging over Unity</strong> or vice versa. We have laid down the following table to compare the different features of Blender with that of Unity.</p>
<p>| |  Unity            | Blender                                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                         |<br>| ——————- | ————————————————————————————————————————- | ————————————————————————————————————————————— |<br>| <strong>About</strong>           | It is a game engine that enables you in creating human-machine interfaces, AR simulations, customize splash screens, etc. | It is a computer graphics software that is open source and is mainly used for creating 3D models.                                       |<br>| <strong>Types Supported</strong> | Supports 3D                                                                                                               |                                                                                                                                         |<br>| <strong>Best Purpose</strong>    | Ideal for film, architecture, automotive, transportation, and other industries                                            | Ideal for animation and design that assists in VFX, simulation, organizations of all sizes with rendering, modeling, and video editing. |</p>
<p>There are many features that Blender lacks, but Unity includes. The features included in Unity but are absent in Blender are as follows.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Drawing</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Games</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> In-Game Analytics</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Multi-player Gaming Network</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Player Management</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Virtual Reality</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> IT Asset Management</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Prototype Creation</p>
<p>Therefore, it is preferred to opt for <strong>Unity rigging</strong> than Blender rigging, as Blender lacks a considerable number of features.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-How-To-Use-Animation-Rigging-In-Unity"><a href="#Part-3-How-To-Use-Animation-Rigging-In-Unity" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 How To Use Animation Rigging In Unity"></a>Part 3 How To Use Animation Rigging In Unity</h2><p>Now, we will be introducing you to the different steps that will help you in <strong>unity rig animation</strong>. The following list includes the steps in the sequence that, when you deploy, will help you rig in the platform of Unity.</p>
<h5 id="Step-1Installation"><a href="#Step-1Installation" class="headerlink" title="Step 1Installation"></a>Step 1Installation</h5><p>The first step is to install the “<strong>animation rigging package” of Unity</strong>. You will get the animation rigging package in the “Package Manager”. You will be able to avail of this animation package in Unity 2019.1 and above.</p>
<p>This package offers you a library that consists of rig constraints. And this library of rig constraints enables you to create procedural motion during the runtime. And the general term used for this is called “runtime rigging”.</p>
<p>The “Asset’s Animator Root” consist of the “Rig Builder Component”, which is the source where the rigs are accumulated. The rigs here are the constraints put together in groups. With these steps you will be able to create <strong>Unity humanoid rig</strong> that will make your animation creations look the finest, most realistic and most professional.</p>

<h5 id="Step-2Rig-Builder-set-up"><a href="#Step-2Rig-Builder-set-up" class="headerlink" title="Step 2Rig Builder set-up"></a>Step 2Rig Builder set-up</h5><p>After installing the <strong>unity animation rigging package</strong>, the next step is to set up the rig builder. You will have to use the “Animator component” in this step. Using the “Animator component”, integrate the “Rig Builder component” with the “GameObject”. Generally, in the hierarchy of rig, it is the topmost “Transform”.</p>
<p>Then, you will have to make a new child GameObject. To which, you will have to integrate the “Rig component”. After this step, you need to access the “Animator root”, where you will find the “Rig Builder component”. In the “Rig Builder component”, you need to assign the “Rig to the Rig Layers” list.</p>
<p>It will complete the task of creating the most basic rig. The further steps will help you install the required behaviours in the character or characters.</p>

<h5 id="Step-3Bone-Rendering"><a href="#Step-3Bone-Rendering" class="headerlink" title="Step 3Bone Rendering"></a>Step 3Bone Rendering</h5><p>Whether it is <strong>unity rigging</strong> or 3D, bone rendering is the most crucial step to enable your animation characters to gain movement. The “Unity Editor” will help you interact and work with the character’s skeleton in the “Scene view.”</p>
<p>You can add “Transform” lists and then display them in various visual styles with the help of the “Bone Renderer: component. It enables you to integrate numerous “Bone Renderer” components, each of them having its unique style of display. As a result, gameplay debugging, rig setup, keyframing, and other artist workflows are facilitated.</p>

<p>Animation is one such aspect that is formed from the integration of several varied factors and processes. One of the most vital ones is the process of rigging. Thus, we will be discussing <strong>Unity character rigging</strong> as Unity is one of the most efficient platforms for animation.</p>
<p>Additionally, we will introduce you to one of the best tools you can use to edit videos and nurture the creative skills you carry in yourself. So, without any further delay, let us start our discussion.</p>
<h4 id="In-this-article-17"><a href="#In-this-article-17" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 [What is Unity Rigging?](#Part 1)</p>
<p>02 [Is It Better to Rig in Unity or Blender?](#Part 2)</p>
<p>03 [How To Use Animation Rigging In Unity](#Part 3)</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Unity-Rigging-1"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Unity-Rigging-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is Unity Rigging?"></a>Part 1 What is Unity Rigging?</h2><p>To understand what <strong>Unity rigging</strong> is, we must start our discussion first by discussing rigging in animation. In animation, rigging is the process in which your animation characters are separated into two parts. One is the mesh-like structure of the characters. And the other is the skeletal structure given to the characters.</p>
<p>You integrate bones and joints and join them accordingly in the characters present in your animation. It is similar to the presence of the human skeletal system. Moreover, just like the skeletal system in humans helps in the movements of the different parts of the body, the bone and joint structure through rigging also enables the characters in animation to move.</p>
<p>Therefore, we can say that rigging is the process by which you can enable your characters’ in animation to move and show different facial expressions, etc. So, it is obvious that without the process of rigging, the animation is impossible, which makes rigging one of the most crucial aspects of animation.</p>
<p>Now that we know what rigging in animation is, we will be discussing what is <strong>animation rigging in Unity</strong>. Unity technologies have developed a cross-platform gaming engine called ‘Unity’. And this platform also offers the ones interested in animation to learn animation rigging.</p>
<p>The Unity platform offers robust and effective tools for animation rigging. And these tools assist the animators to create real-time rigs in Unity. Most commonly, the set of tools in Unity for rigging is used on the characters. But, if one likes, they can also use the tools on ani Game Object that includes animations and skeletons.</p>
<p>Therefore, when you utilise the platform of Unity or the toolsets of Unity to perform rigging in animation, it can be referred to as <strong>unity rigging</strong>. It is one of the most powerful and renowned platforms for animation, creating the finest and most professional animation creations.</p>

A common question arises as to whether one should choose <strong>blender rigging over Unity</strong> or vice versa. We have laid down the following table to compare the different features of Blender with that of Unity.</p>
<p>| |  Unity            | Blender                                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                         |<br>| ——————- | ————————————————————————————————————————- | ————————————————————————————————————————————— |<br>| <strong>About</strong>           | It is a game engine that enables you in creating human-machine interfaces, AR simulations, customize splash screens, etc. | It is a computer graphics software that is open source and is mainly used for creating 3D models.                                       |<br>| <strong>Types Supported</strong> | Supports 3D                                                                                                               |                                                                                                                                         |<br>| <strong>Best Purpose</strong>    | Ideal for film, architecture, automotive, transportation, and other industries                                            | Ideal for animation and design that assists in VFX, simulation, organizations of all sizes with rendering, modeling, and video editing. |</p>
<p>There are many features that Blender lacks, but Unity includes. The features included in Unity but are absent in Blender are as follows.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Drawing</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Games</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> In-Game Analytics</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Multi-player Gaming Network</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Player Management</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Virtual Reality</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> IT Asset Management</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Prototype Creation</p>
<p>Therefore, it is preferred to opt for <strong>Unity rigging</strong> than Blender rigging, as Blender lacks a considerable number of features.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-How-To-Use-Animation-Rigging-In-Unity-1"><a href="#Part-3-How-To-Use-Animation-Rigging-In-Unity-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 How To Use Animation Rigging In Unity"></a>Part 3 How To Use Animation Rigging In Unity</h2><p>Now, we will be introducing you to the different steps that will help you in <strong>unity rig animation</strong>. The following list includes the steps in the sequence that, when you deploy, will help you rig in the platform of Unity.</p>
<h5 id="Step-1Installation-1"><a href="#Step-1Installation-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 1Installation"></a>Step 1Installation</h5><p>The first step is to install the “<strong>animation rigging package” of Unity</strong>. You will get the animation rigging package in the “Package Manager”. You will be able to avail of this animation package in Unity 2019.1 and above.</p>
<p>This package offers you a library that consists of rig constraints. And this library of rig constraints enables you to create procedural motion during the runtime. And the general term used for this is called “runtime rigging”.</p>
<p>The “Asset’s Animator Root” consist of the “Rig Builder Component”, which is the source where the rigs are accumulated. The rigs here are the constraints put together in groups. With these steps you will be able to create <strong>Unity humanoid rig</strong> that will make your animation creations look the finest, most realistic and most professional.</p>

<h5 id="Step-2Rig-Builder-set-up-1"><a href="#Step-2Rig-Builder-set-up-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 2Rig Builder set-up"></a>Step 2Rig Builder set-up</h5><p>After installing the <strong>unity animation rigging package</strong>, the next step is to set up the rig builder. You will have to use the “Animator component” in this step. Using the “Animator component”, integrate the “Rig Builder component” with the “GameObject”. Generally, in the hierarchy of rig, it is the topmost “Transform”.</p>
<p>Then, you will have to make a new child GameObject. To which, you will have to integrate the “Rig component”. After this step, you need to access the “Animator root”, where you will find the “Rig Builder component”. In the “Rig Builder component”, you need to assign the “Rig to the Rig Layers” list.</p>
<p>It will complete the task of creating the most basic rig. The further steps will help you install the required behaviours in the character or characters.</p>

<h5 id="Step-3Bone-Rendering-1"><a href="#Step-3Bone-Rendering-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 3Bone Rendering"></a>Step 3Bone Rendering</h5><p>Whether it is <strong>unity rigging</strong> or 3D, bone rendering is the most crucial step to enable your animation characters to gain movement. The “Unity Editor” will help you interact and work with the character’s skeleton in the “Scene view.”</p>
<p>You can add “Transform” lists and then display them in various visual styles with the help of the “Bone Renderer: component. It enables you to integrate numerous “Bone Renderer” components, each of them having its unique style of display. As a result, gameplay debugging, rig setup, keyframing, and other artist workflows are facilitated.</p>

In animation, rigging is the process in which your animation characters are separated into two parts. One is the mesh-like structure of the characters. And the other is the skeletal structure given to the characters.</p>
<p>You integrate bones and joints and join them accordingly in the characters present in your animation. It is similar to the presence of the human skeletal system. Moreover, just like the skeletal system in humans helps in the movements of the different parts of the body, the bone and joint structure through rigging also enables the characters in animation to move.</p>
<p>Therefore, we can say that rigging is the process by which you can enable your characters’ in animation to move and show different facial expressions, etc. So, it is obvious that without the process of rigging, the animation is impossible, which makes rigging one of the most crucial aspects of animation.</p>
<p>Now that we know what rigging in animation is, we will be discussing what is <strong>animation rigging in Unity</strong>. Unity technologies have developed a cross-platform gaming engine called ‘Unity’. And this platform also offers the ones interested in animation to learn animation rigging.</p>
<p>The Unity platform offers robust and effective tools for animation rigging. And these tools assist the animators to create real-time rigs in Unity. Most commonly, the set of tools in Unity for rigging is used on the characters. But, if one likes, they can also use the tools on ani Game Object that includes animations and skeletons.</p>
<p>Therefore, when you utilise the platform of Unity or the toolsets of Unity to perform rigging in animation, it can be referred to as <strong>unity rigging</strong>. It is one of the most powerful and renowned platforms for animation, creating the finest and most professional animation creations.</p>

<p>There are many features that Blender lacks, but Unity includes. The features included in Unity but are absent in Blender are as follows.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Drawing</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Games</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> In-Game Analytics</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Multi-player Gaming Network</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Player Management</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Virtual Reality</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> IT Asset Management</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Prototype Creation</p>
<p>Therefore, it is preferred to opt for <strong>Unity rigging</strong> than Blender rigging, as Blender lacks a considerable number of features.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-How-To-Use-Animation-Rigging-In-Unity-2"><a href="#Part-3-How-To-Use-Animation-Rigging-In-Unity-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 How To Use Animation Rigging In Unity"></a>Part 3 How To Use Animation Rigging In Unity</h2><p>Now, we will be introducing you to the different steps that will help you in <strong>unity rig animation</strong>. The following list includes the steps in the sequence that, when you deploy, will help you rig in the platform of Unity.</p>
<h5 id="Step-1Installation-2"><a href="#Step-1Installation-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 1Installation"></a>Step 1Installation</h5><p>The first step is to install the “<strong>animation rigging package” of Unity</strong>. You will get the animation rigging package in the “Package Manager”. You will be able to avail of this animation package in Unity 2019.1 and above.</p>
<p>This package offers you a library that consists of rig constraints. And this library of rig constraints enables you to create procedural motion during the runtime. And the general term used for this is called “runtime rigging”.</p>
<p>The “Asset’s Animator Root” consist of the “Rig Builder Component”, which is the source where the rigs are accumulated. The rigs here are the constraints put together in groups. With these steps you will be able to create <strong>Unity humanoid rig</strong> that will make your animation creations look the finest, most realistic and most professional.</p>

<h5 id="Step-2Rig-Builder-set-up-2"><a href="#Step-2Rig-Builder-set-up-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 2Rig Builder set-up"></a>Step 2Rig Builder set-up</h5><p>After installing the <strong>unity animation rigging package</strong>, the next step is to set up the rig builder. You will have to use the “Animator component” in this step. Using the “Animator component”, integrate the “Rig Builder component” with the “GameObject”. Generally, in the hierarchy of rig, it is the topmost “Transform”.</p>
<p>Then, you will have to make a new child GameObject. To which, you will have to integrate the “Rig component”. After this step, you need to access the “Animator root”, where you will find the “Rig Builder component”. In the “Rig Builder component”, you need to assign the “Rig to the Rig Layers” list.</p>
<p>It will complete the task of creating the most basic rig. The further steps will help you install the required behaviours in the character or characters.</p>

<h5 id="Step-3Bone-Rendering-2"><a href="#Step-3Bone-Rendering-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 3Bone Rendering"></a>Step 3Bone Rendering</h5><p>Whether it is <strong>unity rigging</strong> or 3D, bone rendering is the most crucial step to enable your animation characters to gain movement. The “Unity Editor” will help you interact and work with the character’s skeleton in the “Scene view.”</p>
<p>You can add “Transform” lists and then display them in various visual styles with the help of the “Bone Renderer: component. It enables you to integrate numerous “Bone Renderer” components, each of them having its unique style of display. As a result, gameplay debugging, rig setup, keyframing, and other artist workflows are facilitated.</p>

<h5 id="Step-5Managing-the-Rig-Constraints-2"><a href="#Step-5Managing-the-Rig-Constraints-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 5Managing the Rig Constraints"></a>Step 5Managing the Rig Constraints</h5><p>Your characters gain “runtime animation” through the rig constraints, and thus, these are the building blocks facilitating assembling the rigs. The rigs are combined in multiple and varied ways to obtain the desired motions and movements in the characters.</p>

<p>| |  Unity            | Blender                                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                         |<br>| ——————- | ————————————————————————————————————————- | ————————————————————————————————————————————— |<br>| <strong>About</strong>           | It is a game engine that enables you in creating human-machine interfaces, AR simulations, customize splash screens, etc. | It is a computer graphics software that is open source and is mainly used for creating 3D models.                                       |<br>| <strong>Types Supported</strong> | Supports 3D                                                                                                               |                                                                                                                                         |<br>| <strong>Best Purpose</strong>    | Ideal for film, architecture, automotive, transportation, and other industries                                            | Ideal for animation and design that assists in VFX, simulation, organizations of all sizes with rendering, modeling, and video editing. |</p>
<p>There are many features that Blender lacks, but Unity includes. The features included in Unity but are absent in Blender are as follows.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Drawing</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Games</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> In-Game Analytics</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Multi-player Gaming Network</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Player Management</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Virtual Reality</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> IT Asset Management</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Prototype Creation</p>
<p>Therefore, it is preferred to opt for <strong>Unity rigging</strong> than Blender rigging, as Blender lacks a considerable number of features.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-How-To-Use-Animation-Rigging-In-Unity-3"><a href="#Part-3-How-To-Use-Animation-Rigging-In-Unity-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 How To Use Animation Rigging In Unity"></a>Part 3 How To Use Animation Rigging In Unity</h2><p>Now, we will be introducing you to the different steps that will help you in <strong>unity rig animation</strong>. The following list includes the steps in the sequence that, when you deploy, will help you rig in the platform of Unity.</p>
<h5 id="Step-1Installation-3"><a href="#Step-1Installation-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 1Installation"></a>Step 1Installation</h5><p>The first step is to install the “<strong>animation rigging package” of Unity</strong>. You will get the animation rigging package in the “Package Manager”. You will be able to avail of this animation package in Unity 2019.1 and above.</p>
<p>This package offers you a library that consists of rig constraints. And this library of rig constraints enables you to create procedural motion during the runtime. And the general term used for this is called “runtime rigging”.</p>
<p>The “Asset’s Animator Root” consist of the “Rig Builder Component”, which is the source where the rigs are accumulated. The rigs here are the constraints put together in groups. With these steps you will be able to create <strong>Unity humanoid rig</strong> that will make your animation creations look the finest, most realistic and most professional.</p>

                ></p>
<h5 id="Step-2Rig-Builder-set-up-3"><a href="#Step-2Rig-Builder-set-up-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 2Rig Builder set-up"></a>Step 2Rig Builder set-up</h5><p>After installing the <strong>unity animation rigging package</strong>, the next step is to set up the rig builder. You will have to use the “Animator component” in this step. Using the “Animator component”, integrate the “Rig Builder component” with the “GameObject”. Generally, in the hierarchy of rig, it is the topmost “Transform”.</p>
<p>Then, you will have to make a new child GameObject. To which, you will have to integrate the “Rig component”. After this step, you need to access the “Animator root”, where you will find the “Rig Builder component”. In the “Rig Builder component”, you need to assign the “Rig to the Rig Layers” list.</p>
<p>It will complete the task of creating the most basic rig. The further steps will help you install the required behaviours in the character or characters.</p>

<h5 id="Step-3Bone-Rendering-3"><a href="#Step-3Bone-Rendering-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 3Bone Rendering"></a>Step 3Bone Rendering</h5><p>Whether it is <strong>unity rigging</strong> or 3D, bone rendering is the most crucial step to enable your animation characters to gain movement. The “Unity Editor” will help you interact and work with the character’s skeleton in the “Scene view.”</p>
<p>You can add “Transform” lists and then display them in various visual styles with the help of the “Bone Renderer: component. It enables you to integrate numerous “Bone Renderer” components, each of them having its unique style of display. As a result, gameplay debugging, rig setup, keyframing, and other artist workflows are facilitated.</p>

<h5 id="Step-4Adding-Rig-Effectors-3"><a href="#Step-4Adding-Rig-Effectors-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 4Adding Rig Effectors"></a>Step 4Adding Rig Effectors</h5><p>This step enables one to add Gizmos to Transforms, facilitating selection and visualisation. The “Effector” are invisible during “Game View”, and this step enhances the quality of the character animation.</p>

<h5 id="Step-5Managing-the-Rig-Constraints-3"><a href="#Step-5Managing-the-Rig-Constraints-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 5Managing the Rig Constraints"></a>Step 5Managing the Rig Constraints</h5><p>Your characters gain “runtime animation” through the rig constraints, and thus, these are the building blocks facilitating assembling the rigs. The rigs are combined in multiple and varied ways to obtain the desired motions and movements in the characters.</p>

<h5 id="Step-6Working-with-the-Two-Bone-IK-Constraint-3"><a href="#Step-6Working-with-the-Two-Bone-IK-Constraint-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 6Working with the Two Bone IK Constraint"></a>Step 6Working with the Two Bone IK Constraint</h5><p>The first step here is to rest your character to the “Bind Pose.” you can do so by opting for the “Menu Bar” and selecting the “Animation Rigging” option. You will find the “Bind Pose” option there, and you will have to click on it.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="bind pose unity"
                ></p>
<p>Then add a child GameObject below “Character Rig”. Then add a new child GameObject below “Right Arm IK”. Integrate two new child GameObjects beneath the “Right Arm Ik” by naming the first and the second one “RH IK Target” and “RH IK Hint”, respectively.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="rh ik hint unity"
                ></p>
<p>Integrate the “Rig Builder Component” with the “Animator root GameObject”. Then proceed with selecting the “CharecterRig GameObject” and integrating a “Rig Component”. Select “Two Bone IK Contrainst” to the “Right Arm IK.”</p>
<p><img

                      alt="rig component unity"
                ></p>
<p>Then, incorporate a “Box Effector” to the RH IK Target. Integrate a “Ball Effector” to the “RH IK Hint”.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="rh ik hint unity 2"
                ></p>
<p>Then select the “RH IK Hint” and “Right Elbow”. Select “Animation Rigging&gt;align Transform”. Move away from the “Ball Effector”. Select the “Right Arm IK GameObject” and integrate the required bones. Integrate the Character Rig GameObkect with Rig Layer list by selecting the option of “Ninja”. Then press “Play” and see your creation come to life.</p>
