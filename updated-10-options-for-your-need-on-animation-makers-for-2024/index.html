<p><strong>Step 1: Make use of a Gboard.</strong></p>
<p>Enter the chat of the friend or person to whom you want to send the GIF and maximize or open the keyboard using the text bar.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/snapchat-gif-5.jpg.jpg"
                      alt="save and share"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Select the GIF you want.</strong></p>
<p>Choose a GIF from the collection or catalog that you’d want to utilize and submit it.</p>

<p>• Go to Settings&gt; System&gt; Languages and Input&gt; Virtual Keyboard and select it.</p>
<p>• Double-check that Gboard is selected as your primary keyboard.</p>
<p>After that, grant any permissions it requires so that you can use it right away in Snapchat.</p>
<p>Now that it’s as simple as it gets, let’s send comparable GIFs utilizing iOS devices.</p>
<p>For iPhone&#x2F;iPad:</p>

<p><strong>Step 1: Make use of a Gboard.</strong></p>
<p>Enter the chat of the friend or person to whom you want to send the GIF and maximize or open the keyboard using the text bar.</p>
