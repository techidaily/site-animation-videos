You need to add sound additionally to these files to create musical GIF videos. When trying to make your own <strong>music GIF video</strong>, you can take help of the following tools:</p>
<h3 id="01Kapwing-Editor"><a href="#01Kapwing-Editor" class="headerlink" title="01Kapwing Editor"></a>01Kapwing Editor</h3><p>This one is a free online tool that helps you add audio to your GIFs. This application is free from issues of spam and watermark requirements. It assures you of a quality editing experience without supporting unnecessary and annoying advertisements.</p>
<p>Using this tool, you can create musical GIF videos in two different ways. Take the following steps to create musical GIF videos with this application:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Using The Kapwing Studio:</strong></p>
<p>Open the Studio and select the GIF and music files you want to merge. Upload the selected files in the tool.</p>
<p>Customize your audio in the Studio timeline to trim the sound file to the specific segment you wish to add to your GIF. You can also introduce volume adjustments and waveform effects to enhance your <strong>music video for GIF</strong> for an extra catch.</p>
<p>You can further add text and make size adjustments to your GIF using the sidebar controls.</p>
<p>Once you have finalized everything, click ‘Export’ to download the GIF music video in MP4 format. Note that if you download the GIF format, your video will lose the sound effect.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Copy-Paste Method</strong></p>
<p>You can also merge <strong>GIFs and music videos</strong> using the direct copy-paste method in the Kapwing Editor. To create one for yourself, here’s what you need to follow:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: GIF Upload</strong></p>
<p>Select a GIF from your smartphone or PC gallery and upload it to the Kapwing Editor. You can even copy a GIF link from other apps like, YouTube, GIFHY, etc, and paste it in the editor timeline.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Audio Upload</strong></p>
<p>Next, you need to upload the audio file you want to get stitched with your GIF. Choose a file either from your system or copy-paste the YouTube URL of the selected video in the Kapwing timeline.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Export Your Creation</strong></p>
<p>That it! You are done with your creation. Click ‘Export’ to share your musical GIF video on different social platforms.</p>

<h3 id="02VEED’S-GIF-Maker"><a href="#02VEED’S-GIF-Maker" class="headerlink" title="02VEED’S GIF Maker"></a>02VEED’S GIF Maker</h3><p>Like the Kapwing Editor, this one is also a free online tool that you can use to add sound to your originally mute GIF files. What’s more interesting is, apart from adding music, you have the flexibility to draw over, add text and images to your GIFs before you proceed with adding sound to your selected GIF.</p>
<p>Follow the steps given below to start creating <strong>GIF music videos</strong> with this application:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Upload GIF File</strong></p>
<p>To begin, upload your selected GIF file to the application’s pop-up window using ‘Drag and Drop’ method. Alternatively, you can click on ‘Choose GIF File’ tab on the app’s welcome window. Select a file from your system’s gallery and click ‘Open’ to upload it.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Add Music</strong></p>
<p>To add audio files, select ‘Upload’ or tap the (+) sign at the bottom right to choose the desired music files. Drag them to VEED’s timeline to set them in the order of your preference.</p>

                      alt="VEED&#39;S Sound Selection Pop-up Window"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Download Your Creation</strong></p>
<p>Your video gets created in MP4 format. Tap ‘Export’ to directly share it with your peers on Twitter, Facebook or other social platforms.</p>
