<p><strong>Cartoon painting</strong> is slowly becoming popular due to its many benefits, especially <strong>easy cartoon canvas painting</strong>. For instance, it is pretty eye-grabbing, especially if your audience is children.</p>

<p>Thanks to the animation aspect, it has become relatively cheap to do advertisements with cartoons instead of real people.</p>

These <strong>cartoons to draw</strong> include:</p>
<h3 id="01-Illustrative-Cartoons"><a href="#01-Illustrative-Cartoons" class="headerlink" title="01 Illustrative Cartoons"></a>01 Illustrative Cartoons</h3><p>They are the most suitable cartoons to draw when portraying particular ideas directly and simply.</p>
<p>The cartoons are primarily used in advertisements, teaching aids, and explaining stories. They also have text that explains them further.</p>
<p>It explains why they are common in school books, making them perfect for explaining content or subject.</p>

<h3 id="02-Animated-Cartoons"><a href="#02-Animated-Cartoons" class="headerlink" title="02 Animated Cartoons"></a>02 Animated Cartoons</h3><p>It is important to note that these cartoons are drawn using computers despite looking as if they are hand-drawn. One thing that makes them stand out is that they seem to be in action and movement.</p>
<p>As much as that’s how they seem from the viewer’s perspective, that’s far from the truth. They are just drawn in series, and since the first one will differ from the second one, there is that illusion of movement created.</p>

<h3 id="03-Comic-Strips-or-Panels"><a href="#03-Comic-Strips-or-Panels" class="headerlink" title="03 Comic Strips or Panels"></a>03 Comic Strips or Panels</h3><p>In most cases, these are regular features characterized by established or known characters and usually displayed in newspapers.</p>
<p>Just like the animated cartoons, they are showcased in series to tell or illustrate a story. The series of panels have words said by the various characters.</p>
<p>The words are usually in balloons, and a single comic strip may cover a single or double page of a newspaper.</p>

<h3 id="04-Gag-Cartoons"><a href="#04-Gag-Cartoons" class="headerlink" title="04 Gag Cartoons"></a>04 Gag Cartoons</h3><p>As the name gag suggests, these cartoons revolve around jokes. These single-paneled cartoons often make fun of human beings.</p>
<p>Through overstatements, humor resonates from what is drawn. They can either serve as entertainment or point out, if not make fun of, people, especially their mistakes and faults. Besides the cartoon, expect a caption that’s often a single sentence.</p>

<h3 id="05-Editorial-or-Political-Cartoons"><a href="#05-Editorial-or-Political-Cartoons" class="headerlink" title="05 Editorial or Political Cartoons"></a>05 Editorial or Political Cartoons</h3><p>These cartoons are also made for the newspapers. Expect them to be a single drawing on an editorial page. It sheds more light on a particular newspaper’s editorial comment.</p>
<p>As much as some have captions, that’s not always the case. Just like the gag cartoons, they ridicule people, but the editorial ones focus on celebrities.</p>

So, feel encouraged because you stand a chance also to become an expert in the long run. All you need to do is take the first step. Fortunately, we are here to hold your hand as you do so. So. Without further ado, let’s get started.</p>
<h3 id="01-Cartoon-Painting-of-a-Young-Character"><a href="#01-Cartoon-Painting-of-a-Young-Character" class="headerlink" title="01 Cartoon Painting of a Young Character"></a>01 Cartoon Painting of a Young Character</h3><p><strong>These are the steps you need to follow when doing so:</strong></p>
<h5 id="Step-1Start-with-the-face"><a href="#Step-1Start-with-the-face" class="headerlink" title="Step 1Start with the face"></a>Step 1Start with the face</h5><p>The face is significant, especially when it comes to cartoon painting. It has complex as well as simple parts. For example, the face itself is pretty basic since you will need to begin with a circle.</p>
<p>After that, draw a horizontal and vertical line and ensure that they intersect in the middle.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<h5 id="Step-2Draw-the-eyes-by-drawing"><a href="#Step-2Draw-the-eyes-by-drawing" class="headerlink" title="Step 2Draw the eyes by drawing"></a>Step 2Draw the eyes by drawing</h5><p>Draw the eyes by drawing an oval and ensuring that the top side is slightly tilting to the side.</p>
<p>Do the same thing on the other side since the norm is a pair of eyes. The gap between the two should also be sensible.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Draw the eyes by drawing"
                ></p>
<h5 id="Step-3Draw-eyebrows"><a href="#Step-3Draw-eyebrows" class="headerlink" title="Step 3Draw eyebrows"></a>Step 3Draw eyebrows</h5><p>On the upper side of the eye, ensure that the lines are slightly thick. The eyebrows also need to be placed above the eyes, slightly above the thick line representing the eyelashes.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="draw eyebrows"
                ></p>
<h5 id="Step-4Draw-jaw"><a href="#Step-4Draw-jaw" class="headerlink" title="Step 4Draw jaw"></a>Step 4Draw jaw</h5><p>After that, start shaping the jaw. Keep in mind that it plays a huge role in determining whether the character will look thin or fat. Additionally, how you draw the jaw determines whether the character will be old or young and how old or young the person will look.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<h5 id="Step-5Draw-nose"><a href="#Step-5Draw-nose" class="headerlink" title="Step 5Draw nose"></a>Step 5Draw nose</h5><p>Design the nose and ensure that you don’t put many details. The good thing about the nose is that a tip is enough to serve the purpose. Another common approach when drawing the nose is doing so as if you are viewing it from the side.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Draw nose"
                ></p>
<h5 id="Step-6Draw-mouth"><a href="#Step-6Draw-mouth" class="headerlink" title="Step 6Draw mouth"></a>Step 6Draw mouth</h5><p>Next, draw the mouth and consider the age of your character as you do so. If it is a child, despite the gender, stick to simplicity. You should also avoid drawing the lips. Preferably, go for the good, expressive trace since it never disappoints.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<h5 id="Step-7Draw-ears"><a href="#Step-7Draw-ears" class="headerlink" title="Step 7Draw ears"></a>Step 7Draw ears</h5><p>Proceed to the ears and in relation to whether the character is facing the camera or not. If your character is looking at the camera, you should see the front side view. Therefore, it won’t make sense to display the internal cavities in this case.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/in-depth-study-of-cartoon-painting-starts-from-learning-to-draw-it-12.jpg"
                      alt="Draw ears"
                ></p>
<h5 id="Step-8Draw-haircut"><a href="#Step-8Draw-haircut" class="headerlink" title="Step 8Draw haircut"></a>Step 8Draw haircut</h5><p>Proceed to the ears and in relation to whether the character is facing the camera or not. If your character is looking at the camera, you should see the front side view. Therefore, it won’t make sense to display the internal cavities in this case.</p>
<p>As scary as it may look, you need not be an expert to make the haircut look perfect. Additionally, there is no constant way of drawing the haircut, and you are at liberty to practice as much creativity as possible.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, please don’t take it lightly since it can be quite descriptive. For instance, the hair is used to tell the personality of a character. Practice makes perfect, and you better keep doing it until you get it right. Ensure that what you draw shows the age and character of the cartoons to draw as perfectly as possible.</p>
<p>So far, our focus has been on a young character. However, that’s not always the case explaining why we will look at a cartoon painting of an old character.</p>

Start with the eyes and add their pupils, eyebrows and don’t forget to add wrinkles.</p>
<p>Since the character is old compared to the previous one, ensure that the eyebrows are thick. They should occupy more space of the forehead.</p>

To achieve that, make the nose look close to the eyes</p>

That’s one common characteristic of an old character, especially male.</p>

So, what do you do if you want to create a female one instead? These are some of the steps to follow as you do so.</p>
<p>The procedure is not that different. However, consider that women’s facial structures are more delicate than those of their male counterparts. Some of the things that stand out include long hair, a small nose, a thin chin, thin eyebrows, and large, expressive eyelashes. Large pupils will also do, especially if you are good at drawing.</p>

<p>As much as that’s how they seem from the viewer’s perspective, that’s far from the truth. They are just drawn in series, and since the first one will differ from the second one, there is that illusion of movement created.</p>

<p>Just like the animated cartoons, they are showcased in series to tell or illustrate a story. The series of panels have words said by the various characters.</p>

<p>As much as some have captions, that’s not always the case. Just like the gag cartoons, they ridicule people, but the editorial ones focus on celebrities.</p>

So, feel encouraged because you stand a chance also to become an expert in the long run. All you need to do is take the first step. Fortunately, we are here to hold your hand as you do so. So. Without further ado, let’s get started.</p>
<h3 id="01-Cartoon-Painting-of-a-Young-Character-1"><a href="#01-Cartoon-Painting-of-a-Young-Character-1" class="headerlink" title="01 Cartoon Painting of a Young Character"></a>01 Cartoon Painting of a Young Character</h3><p><strong>These are the steps you need to follow when doing so:</strong></p>
<h5 id="Step-1Start-with-the-face-1"><a href="#Step-1Start-with-the-face-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 1Start with the face"></a>Step 1Start with the face</h5><p>The face is significant, especially when it comes to cartoon painting. It has complex as well as simple parts. For example, the face itself is pretty basic since you will need to begin with a circle.</p>
<p>After that, draw a horizontal and vertical line and ensure that they intersect in the middle.</p>

<p>Do the same thing on the other side since the norm is a pair of eyes. The gap between the two should also be sensible.</p>
<p><img

<h5 id="Step-3Draw-eyebrows-1"><a href="#Step-3Draw-eyebrows-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 3Draw eyebrows"></a>Step 3Draw eyebrows</h5><p>On the upper side of the eye, ensure that the lines are slightly thick. The eyebrows also need to be placed above the eyes, slightly above the thick line representing the eyelashes.</p>

<h5 id="Step-4Draw-jaw-1"><a href="#Step-4Draw-jaw-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 4Draw jaw"></a>Step 4Draw jaw</h5><p>After that, start shaping the jaw. Keep in mind that it plays a huge role in determining whether the character will look thin or fat. Additionally, how you draw the jaw determines whether the character will be old or young and how old or young the person will look.</p>

<h5 id="Step-5Draw-nose-1"><a href="#Step-5Draw-nose-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 5Draw nose"></a>Step 5Draw nose</h5><p>Design the nose and ensure that you don’t put many details. The good thing about the nose is that a tip is enough to serve the purpose. Another common approach when drawing the nose is doing so as if you are viewing it from the side.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<h5 id="Step-6Draw-mouth-1"><a href="#Step-6Draw-mouth-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 6Draw mouth"></a>Step 6Draw mouth</h5><p>Next, draw the mouth and consider the age of your character as you do so. If it is a child, despite the gender, stick to simplicity. You should also avoid drawing the lips. Preferably, go for the good, expressive trace since it never disappoints.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<h5 id="Step-7Draw-ears-1"><a href="#Step-7Draw-ears-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 7Draw ears"></a>Step 7Draw ears</h5><p>Proceed to the ears and in relation to whether the character is facing the camera or not. If your character is looking at the camera, you should see the front side view. Therefore, it won’t make sense to display the internal cavities in this case.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<h5 id="Step-8Draw-haircut-1"><a href="#Step-8Draw-haircut-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 8Draw haircut"></a>Step 8Draw haircut</h5><p>Proceed to the ears and in relation to whether the character is facing the camera or not. If your character is looking at the camera, you should see the front side view. Therefore, it won’t make sense to display the internal cavities in this case.</p>
<p>As scary as it may look, you need not be an expert to make the haircut look perfect. Additionally, there is no constant way of drawing the haircut, and you are at liberty to practice as much creativity as possible.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, please don’t take it lightly since it can be quite descriptive. For instance, the hair is used to tell the personality of a character. Practice makes perfect, and you better keep doing it until you get it right. Ensure that what you draw shows the age and character of the cartoons to draw as perfectly as possible.</p>
<p>So far, our focus has been on a young character. However, that’s not always the case explaining why we will look at a cartoon painting of an old character.</p>

Start with the eyes and add their pupils, eyebrows and don’t forget to add wrinkles.</p>
<p>Since the character is old compared to the previous one, ensure that the eyebrows are thick. They should occupy more space of the forehead.</p>

So, what do you do if you want to create a female one instead? These are some of the steps to follow as you do so.</p>
<p>The procedure is not that different. However, consider that women’s facial structures are more delicate than those of their male counterparts. Some of the things that stand out include long hair, a small nose, a thin chin, thin eyebrows, and large, expressive eyelashes. Large pupils will also do, especially if you are good at drawing.</p>

<p>As much as some have captions, that’s not always the case. Just like the gag cartoons, they ridicule people, but the editorial ones focus on celebrities.</p>

So, feel encouraged because you stand a chance also to become an expert in the long run. All you need to do is take the first step. Fortunately, we are here to hold your hand as you do so. So. Without further ado, let’s get started.</p>
<h3 id="01-Cartoon-Painting-of-a-Young-Character-2"><a href="#01-Cartoon-Painting-of-a-Young-Character-2" class="headerlink" title="01 Cartoon Painting of a Young Character"></a>01 Cartoon Painting of a Young Character</h3><p><strong>These are the steps you need to follow when doing so:</strong></p>
<h5 id="Step-1Start-with-the-face-2"><a href="#Step-1Start-with-the-face-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 1Start with the face"></a>Step 1Start with the face</h5><p>The face is significant, especially when it comes to cartoon painting. It has complex as well as simple parts. For example, the face itself is pretty basic since you will need to begin with a circle.</p>
<p>After that, draw a horizontal and vertical line and ensure that they intersect in the middle.</p>

<p>Do the same thing on the other side since the norm is a pair of eyes. The gap between the two should also be sensible.</p>
<p><img

<h5 id="Step-3Draw-eyebrows-2"><a href="#Step-3Draw-eyebrows-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 3Draw eyebrows"></a>Step 3Draw eyebrows</h5><p>On the upper side of the eye, ensure that the lines are slightly thick. The eyebrows also need to be placed above the eyes, slightly above the thick line representing the eyelashes.</p>

<h5 id="Step-4Draw-jaw-2"><a href="#Step-4Draw-jaw-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 4Draw jaw"></a>Step 4Draw jaw</h5><p>After that, start shaping the jaw. Keep in mind that it plays a huge role in determining whether the character will look thin or fat. Additionally, how you draw the jaw determines whether the character will be old or young and how old or young the person will look.</p>

<h5 id="Step-5Draw-nose-2"><a href="#Step-5Draw-nose-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 5Draw nose"></a>Step 5Draw nose</h5><p>Design the nose and ensure that you don’t put many details. The good thing about the nose is that a tip is enough to serve the purpose. Another common approach when drawing the nose is doing so as if you are viewing it from the side.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

<h5 id="Step-6Draw-mouth-2"><a href="#Step-6Draw-mouth-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 6Draw mouth"></a>Step 6Draw mouth</h5><p>Next, draw the mouth and consider the age of your character as you do so. If it is a child, despite the gender, stick to simplicity. You should also avoid drawing the lips. Preferably, go for the good, expressive trace since it never disappoints.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<h5 id="Step-7Draw-ears-2"><a href="#Step-7Draw-ears-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 7Draw ears"></a>Step 7Draw ears</h5><p>Proceed to the ears and in relation to whether the character is facing the camera or not. If your character is looking at the camera, you should see the front side view. Therefore, it won’t make sense to display the internal cavities in this case.</p>
<p><img

<h5 id="Step-8Draw-haircut-2"><a href="#Step-8Draw-haircut-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 8Draw haircut"></a>Step 8Draw haircut</h5><p>Proceed to the ears and in relation to whether the character is facing the camera or not. If your character is looking at the camera, you should see the front side view. Therefore, it won’t make sense to display the internal cavities in this case.</p>
<p>As scary as it may look, you need not be an expert to make the haircut look perfect. Additionally, there is no constant way of drawing the haircut, and you are at liberty to practice as much creativity as possible.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, please don’t take it lightly since it can be quite descriptive. For instance, the hair is used to tell the personality of a character. Practice makes perfect, and you better keep doing it until you get it right. Ensure that what you draw shows the age and character of the cartoons to draw as perfectly as possible.</p>
<p>So far, our focus has been on a young character. However, that’s not always the case explaining why we will look at a cartoon painting of an old character.</p>

Start with the eyes and add their pupils, eyebrows and don’t forget to add wrinkles.</p>
<p>Since the character is old compared to the previous one, ensure that the eyebrows are thick. They should occupy more space of the forehead.</p>

So, what do you do if you want to create a female one instead? These are some of the steps to follow as you do so.</p>
<p>The procedure is not that different. However, consider that women’s facial structures are more delicate than those of their male counterparts. Some of the things that stand out include long hair, a small nose, a thin chin, thin eyebrows, and large, expressive eyelashes. Large pupils will also do, especially if you are good at drawing.</p>

<h3 id="01-Illustrative-Cartoons-3"><a href="#01-Illustrative-Cartoons-3" class="headerlink" title="01 Illustrative Cartoons"></a>01 Illustrative Cartoons</h3><p>They are the most suitable cartoons to draw when portraying particular ideas directly and simply.</p>
<p>The cartoons are primarily used in advertisements, teaching aids, and explaining stories. They also have text that explains them further.</p>
<p>It explains why they are common in school books, making them perfect for explaining content or subject.</p>

<h3 id="02-Animated-Cartoons-3"><a href="#02-Animated-Cartoons-3" class="headerlink" title="02 Animated Cartoons"></a>02 Animated Cartoons</h3><p>It is important to note that these cartoons are drawn using computers despite looking as if they are hand-drawn. One thing that makes them stand out is that they seem to be in action and movement.</p>
<p>As much as that’s how they seem from the viewer’s perspective, that’s far from the truth. They are just drawn in series, and since the first one will differ from the second one, there is that illusion of movement created.</p>

<p>Just like the animated cartoons, they are showcased in series to tell or illustrate a story. The series of panels have words said by the various characters.</p>

<p>Through overstatements, humor resonates from what is drawn. They can either serve as entertainment or point out, if not make fun of, people, especially their mistakes and faults. Besides the cartoon, expect a caption that’s often a single sentence.</p>

<p>As scary as it may look, you need not be an expert to make the haircut look perfect. Additionally, there is no constant way of drawing the haircut, and you are at liberty to practice as much creativity as possible.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, please don’t take it lightly since it can be quite descriptive. For instance, the hair is used to tell the personality of a character. Practice makes perfect, and you better keep doing it until you get it right. Ensure that what you draw shows the age and character of the cartoons to draw as perfectly as possible.</p>
<p>So far, our focus has been on a young character. However, that’s not always the case explaining why we will look at a cartoon painting of an old character.</p>

Well, to tell you the truth, it is possible to create <strong>Whatsapp cartoons</strong> and stickers, and the best part is you don’t need any technical expertise to get the job done.</p>

<p>Let me ask you a question - how much fun would it be if you could create your own animated stickers and send them to your friends and family members on Whatsapp? I mean, it would make the entire conversation more fun and also add a personal element to the entire chat. Right? Well, to tell you the truth, it is possible to create <strong>Whatsapp cartoons</strong> and stickers, and the best part is you don’t need any technical expertise to get the job done.</p>
<p>Of course, for a long time, Whatsapp didn’t allow its users to use third-party animated stickers within the messenger. But, recently the messaging platform introduced a custom “stickers pack” feature that now allows people to upload their own stickers and create a dedicated sticker app.</p>
<p>You can also rely on several third-party sticker designer applications to get the job done. So, if you have been looking for a way to use your own face as an animated sticker in Whatsapp, continue reading. In this guide, we’ll walk you through different ways to create and upload a custom cartoon sticker in Whatsapp and make your Whatsapp chats more fun.</p>

There’s no AR feature that’ll turn your face into a cartoon character. So, to use a <strong>cartoon Whatsapp profile picture</strong>, you’ll have to rely on a third-party tool to get the job done. Based on which platform you use to access Whatsapp, you can choose a wide variety of Whatsapp animated sticker creators and use them to design custom cartoon stickers to make traditional Whatsapp conversations more fun.</p>
<p>One of the easiest ways to create custom stickers for Whatsapp is to use Wondershare <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>.

<p>The <strong>animated navbar</strong> also incorporates a few animations that uplift the overall visual appearance of the website.

This will enhance the overall user experience and you’ll be able to encourage one-time visitors to spend more time on your website. Using the navbar will also improve your search engine rankings because the search engine crawler will be able to crawl all the web pages easily.</p>
<h3 id="02Aesthetically-Pleasing"><a href="#02Aesthetically-Pleasing" class="headerlink" title="02Aesthetically Pleasing"></a>02Aesthetically Pleasing</h3><p>The way your website looks has a huge impact on whether you’re going to retain the website visitors or not.

<h3 id="01Search-Engine-Journal"><a href="#01Search-Engine-Journal" class="headerlink" title="01Search Engine Journal"></a>01Search Engine Journal</h3><p><img

<p>Search Engine Journal is an online knowledge hub where users can find every bit of information about digital marketing. The website publishes regular guides on SEO, PPC, Social Media Marketing, etc to help people get detailed insight into the benefits of digital marketing.</p>
<p>Since there are thousands of articles on the website, it could easily get chaotic for users to find the guide they are looking for. But, with an easy-to-navigate <strong>animated sticky navbar</strong>, Search Engine Journal has divided all the articles into their respective categories using simple drop-down menus</p>
<h3 id="02AirBnB"><a href="#02AirBnB" class="headerlink" title="02AirBnB"></a>02AirBnB</h3><p><img

                ></p>
<p>Airbnb is one of the most popular platforms to find vacation homes in a different city&#x2F;country to enjoy your holiday in complete comfort. One of the major reasons behind AirBnB’s immense success is its high-quality and easy-to-use website.</p>
<p>As you continue to scroll down the website, the sticky navbar stays fixed at the top with a dedicated search bar and a “Become a Host” Call-to-Action button. This way it doesn’t matter if a user is looking for a place to rent or simply wants to become a host, they’ll be able to get the job done within a few clicks.</p>
<h3 id="03Graz-Secrets"><a href="#03Graz-Secrets" class="headerlink" title="03Graz Secrets"></a>03Graz Secrets</h3><p><img

                      alt="Graz Secrets"
                ></p>
<p>Graz Secrets is the perfect example of how you can use a sticky bar in the simplest manner and still grab users’ attention easily. The website uses a black-colored simple navigation bar with a “Download Now” button at the center. The button continues to illuminate due to the background animation even if you scroll to the end of the web page. The overall black design of the navbar adds more visual factors to the website and engages the visitors more effectively.</p>
<h3 id="04Adobe"><a href="#04Adobe" class="headerlink" title="04Adobe"></a>04Adobe</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Adobe"
                ></p>
<p>Adobe’s navigation bar is also a great example of how to use sticky navbars to uplift the overall user experience for website visitors. Even though the website doesn’t stay at its place when you scroll down, it immediately comes back as soon as you scroll up once.</p>
<p>Moreover, the navbar has links to all the Adobe products, which means users can visit any product page they want right away. It’s also worth understanding that Adobe has added a dedicated “Sign-in” button in the navigation bar to allow visitors to sign in to the Adobe cloud account straightaway.</p>

The designers have placed a pretty small navigation bar with links to all the important web pages.</p>
<p>The smaller size of the navigation bar doesn’t make the website look cluttered and still manages to do its job easily. In addition to this, the designers have also placed a dedicated logo and the “Up” button to allow users to directly go to the top of the web page with one click.</p>
<h3 id="06Mind-Inventory"><a href="#06Mind-Inventory" class="headerlink" title="06Mind Inventory"></a>06Mind Inventory</h3><p><img

<p>There are dedicated links to other web pages as well. However, you won’t find any drop-down menus. In case your website also has limited web pages, you can also replicate this <strong>animated sticky navbar</strong> to make it more appealing.</p>
<h3 id="08H-M"><a href="#08H-M" class="headerlink" title="08H&amp;M"></a>08H&amp;M</h3><p><img
